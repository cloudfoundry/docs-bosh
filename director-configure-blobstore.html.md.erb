title: Connecting the Director to an External Postgres Database
---

The Director stores uploaded releases, configuration files, logs and other data in a blobstore. A default DAV blobstore is sufficient for most BOSH environments; however, a highly-available external blobstore may be desired.

## <a id="included"></a> Included DAV (default)

By default the Director is configured to use included DAV blobstore job (see [Installing BOSH section](index.html#install) for example manifests). Here is how to configure it:

1. Add blobstore release job and make sure that persistent disk is enabled:

    ```yaml
    jobs:
    - name: bosh
      templates:
      - {name: blobstore, release: bosh}
      # ...
      persistent_disk: 25_000
      # ...
      networks:
      - name: default
        static_ips: [10.0.0.6]
    ```

1. Configure blobstore job. The blobstore's address must be reachable by the Agents:

    ```yaml
    properties:
      blobstore:
        provider: dav
        address: 10.0.0.6
        port: 25250
        director:
          user: director
          password: DIRECTOR-PASSWORD
        agent:
          user: agent
          password: AGENT-PASSWORD
    ```

Above configuration is used by the Director and the Agents.

## <a id="default"></a> S3

The Director and the Agents can use S3 compatible blobstore. Here is how to configure it:

1. Create a *private* S3 bucket

1. Modify deployment manifest for the Director and specify S3 credentials and bucket name:

    ```yaml
    properties:
      blobstore:
        provider: s3
        access_key_id: ACCESS-KEY-ID
        secret_access_key: SECRET-ACCESS-KEY
        bucket_name: test-bosh-bucket
    ```
