## <a id='networks'></a> Networks

Schema for `cloud_properties` section used by manual network subnet:

* **name** [String, required]: Name of the vSphere network. Example: `VM Network`.

**Note:** To assign a distributed virtual portgroup when
there exists a standard virtual portgroup with the same name,
prepend the distributed virtual switch's name followed by a slash to the
distributed virtual portgroup, e.g. `dvs/distributed-portgroup-1`. This may
be required when working with VxRack. Available in v28+.

**Note:** The name may also be an NSX opaque network. Available in v40+.

Example of manual network:

```yaml
networks:
- name: default
  type: manual
  subnets:
  - range: 10.10.0.0/24
    gateway: 10.10.0.1
    cloud_properties:
      name: VM Network
```

vSphere CPI does not support dynamic or vip networks.

## <a id='global'></a> Global Configuration

The CPI can only talk to a single vCenter installation and manage VMs within a single vSphere datacenter.

Schema:

* **host** [String, required]: IP address of the vCenter. Example: `172.16.68.3`.
* **user** [String, required]: Username for the API access. Example: `root`.
* **password** [String, required]: Password for the API access. Example: `vmware`
* **http_logging** [Boolean, optional]: Enables logging all HTTP requests and responses to vSphere API. Default: `false`. Available in v37+.
* **default\_disk\_type** [String, optional]: Sets the default
  [disk type](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/converter-sdk/conv51_apireference/vim.VirtualDiskManager.VirtualDiskType.html).
  Can be either `thin` or `preallocated`, defaults to `preallocated`. `preallocated`
  sets "all space allocated at [VM] creation time and the space is zeroed on demand as the space is used",
  and `thin`, "virtual disk is allocated and zeroed on demand as the space is used."
  Applies to both ephemeral and persistent disks.

* **datacenters** [Array, optional]: Array of datacenters to use for VM placement. Must have only one.
    * **name** [String, required]: Datacenter name.
    * **vm_folder** [String, required]: Path to a folder (relative to the datacenter) for storing created VMs. Folder will be automatically created if not found.
    * **template_folder** [String, required]: Path to a folder (relative to the datacenter) for storing uploaded stemcells. Folder will be automatically created if not found.
    * **disk_path** [String, required]: Path to a *disk* folder for storing persistent disks. Folder will be automatically created in the datastore if not found.
    * **datastore_pattern** [String, required]: Pattern for selecting datastores for storing ephemeral disks and replicated stemcells.
    * **persistent\_datastore\_pattern** [String, required]: Pattern for selecting datastores for storing persistent disks.
    * **clusters** [Array, required]: Array of clusters to use for VM placement.
        * **&lt;cluster name&gt;** [String, required]: Cluster name.
            * **resource_pool** [String, optional]: Specific vSphere resource pool to use within the cluster.
* **nsx** [Dictionary, optional]: NSX configuration options.  This is required if the other NSX features are used below (e.g. 'security\_groups' for `resource\_pools`).
    * **address** [String, required]: The NSX server's address. Can be a hostname (e.g. `nsx-server.example.com`) or an IP address.
    * **user** [String, required]: The login username for the NSX server.
    * **password** [String, required]: The login password for the NSX server.
    * **ca_cert** [String, optional]: A CA certificate that can authenticate the NSX server certificate. **Required** if the NSX Manager has a self-signed SSL certificate. Must be in PEM format.
* **enable\_auto\_anti\_affinity\_drs\_rules** [Boolean, optional]: Creates DRS rule to place VMs on separate hosts. DRS Automation Level must be set to "Fully Automated"; does not work when DRS is set to "Partially Automated" or "Manual". May cause VMs to fail to power on if there are more VMs than hosts after initial deployment. Default: `false`. Available in v33+.
<p class="note">Note: If the NSX Manager has a self-signed certificate, the certificate must be set in the `ca_cert` property.</p>

Example of a CPI configuration that will place VMs into `BOSH_CL` cluster within `BOSH_DC`:

```yaml
properties:
  vcenter:
    address: 172.16.68.3
    user: root
    password: vmware
    datacenters:
    - name: BOSH_DC
      vm_folder: prod-vms
      template_folder: prod-templates
      disk_path: prod-disks
      datastore_pattern: '^prod-ds$'
      persistent_datastore_pattern: '^prod-ds$'
      clusters: [BOSH_CL]
```

Example that places VMs by default into `BOSH_RP` vSphere resource pool with NSX integration and enables VM anti-affinity DRS rule:

```yaml
properties:
  vcenter:
    address: 172.16.68.3
    user: root
    password: vmware
    default_disk_type: thin
    enable_auto_anti_affinity_drs_rules: true
    datacenters:
    - name: BOSH_DC
      vm_folder: prod-vms
      template_folder: prod-templates
      disk_path: prod-disks
      datastore_pattern: '\Aprod-ds\z'
      persistent_datastore_pattern: '\Aprod-ds\z'
      clusters:
      - BOSH_CL: {resource_pool: BOSH_RP}
    nsx:
      address: 172.16.68.4
      user: administrator@vsphere.local
      password: vmware
```

## <a id='notes'></a> Notes

* Assigned VM names (e.g. `vm-8dg349-s7cn74-...`) should not be manually changed since the CPI uses them to find created VMs. You can use [`bosh vms --details`](sysadmin-commands.html#health) to find which VM is assigned which job. VMs are also tagged with their assigned job, index and deployment.

* Storage DRS and vMotion can be used with vSphere CPI version v18 and above. For additional details see [Storage DRS and vMotion Support](vsphere-vmotion-support.html).

* `allow_mixed_datastores` configuration has been deprecated in favor of setting same datastore pattern for `datastore_pattern` and `persistent_datastore_pattern` keys.

* The vSphere CPI requires access to port 80/443 for all the ESXi hosts in your
vSphere resource pool(s).  In order to upload stemcells to vSphere, the
vSphere CPI makes use of an API call that returns a URL that the CPI should
make a `POST` request to in order to upload the stemcell. This URL could have
a hostname that resolves to any one of the ESXi hosts that are associated
with your vSphere resource pool(s).

* Setting `enable_auto_anti_affinity_drs_rules` to true may cause `bosh deploy` to fail after the initial deployment if there are more VMs than hosts. A workaround is to set `enable_auto_anti_affinity_drs_rules` to false to perform subsequent deployments.

### <a id="vms"></a>VMs

VMs have randomly generated cloud identifiers, in the format `"vm-#{SecureRandom.uuid}"`. They are stored on a datacenter as follows:

`datacenter.name/vm/vm_folder.name/vm_cid`

e.g.

 `TEST_DATACENTER/vm/58bc710b-aec7-41f6-bb78-7d65f8033e51/vm-f050dbdb-ddcf-4524-b6d8-fad1135c6f7e`

Your datacenter will be queried for the path above to try and find a matching VM.

There is nothing in the CPI that prevents using an id generated by the cloud for the cloud id. Indeed, the AWS CPI uses the instance ids generated on AWS
for cloud ids. The create_vm() CPI call returns the cid of the created VM, so it's up to the CPI implementor to decide what to use for cloud id.

Although it's technically possible to use the instanceUuid on vSphere (much like how we use AWS instance ids), it's worth noting that this breaks backwards compatibility and would require a fairly hefty migration. This would open up the possibility of allowing an operator to move a VM out of its containing folder on a datacenter, as it would be possible to identify a VM independent of its inventory location.

### <a id="networks"></a>Networks

Networks are uniquely identified by datacenter and network name (which must be unique within the datacenter).

### <a id="datastores"></a>Datastores

Datastores are identified by their name and are matched by a regular expression that matches against that name. For example, consider the following datastores in folders:

- `/foo/bar/datastore1`
- `/foo/bar/anothername`
- `/foo/baz/datastore1`

The name of datastore is the last part of each line above, e.g. 'datastore1'. An operator may choose to select both `/foo/bar/datastore1` and `/foo/baz/datastore1` with the regular expression 'datastore' or even 'datastore1'. They cannot, however, select both `/foo/bar/datastore1` and `/foo/bar/anothername` by using a regular expression that matches against directory structure, e.g. `/foo/bar`.

Ephemeral and persistent datastores are consumed before shared datastores.

#### <a id="datastore-paths"></a>Datastore Paths

Persistent disks are stored on datastores in the following paths:

`/<datacenter disk path from manifest>/disk-<random disk uuid>.vmdk`

#### <a id="linked-clones"></a>Linked Clones

The vSphere CPI uses linked clones by default. Linked clones require the clone to be on the same datastore as the source so stemcells are automatically copied to each datastore that their clones will be on. These stemcells look like `sc-<uuid> / <datastore managed object id>` in the inventory. In the datastore browser the "/" will be quoted to "%2f".

### <a id="clusters"></a>Clusters

Each datacenter can have multiple clusters in the cloud properties.

A cluster is identified by its name and its datacenter. Its location within folders in each datacenter does not matter.

In vSphere, cluster names do not need to be unique per datacenter, only their paths needs to be unique. The current vSphere CPI code does not handle this and would only see one cluster if two had the same name.

Clusters do not have any unique ID like a VM's instanceUuid.

#### <a id="vm-placement"></a>VM Placement

When placing a VM, a cluster is chosen (along with a datastore) based on the VM's memory, ephemeral disk, and persistent disk requirements.

VMs are placed on clusters and datastores based on a weighted random algorithm. The weights are calculated by how many times the requested memory, ephemeral and persistent disk could fit on the cluster.

During VM placement local datastores and shared datastores are not treated differently. All datastores registered on a cluster are treated the same.

##### <a id="locality"></a>Locality

When recreating an existing VM, the CPI tries to create it in a cluster and datastore that are near the largest of its existing persistent disks.

### <a id="datacenters"></a>Datacenters

The vSphere CPI only supports a single datacenter and errors if more than one is defined in the manifest. It is identified by name.

The current code will not work with a datacenter inside a folder.

## <a id='errors'></a> Errors

```
Field object_set is not optional
```

This error may occur when global CPI configuration references:

- cluster (via `clusters` key) that cannot be found in the datacenter
- stemcell that cannot be found in the templates folder

```
...should have the following properties: ["info.progress", "info.state", "info.result", "info.error"] (VSphereCloud::CloudSearcher::MissingPropertiesException), but they were missing these: #<Set: {"info.state"}>
```

Add `System.View` on vCenter server level so that persistent disks can be moved between the datastores.

```
Field counter_id is not optional
...lib/cloud/vsphere/client.rb:270:in `fetch_perf_metric_names'
```

The CPI requires access to performance metrics from ESXi hosts. This error may be returned if one of the hosts in the cluster is not returning these metrics (e.g. `memory.usage.average`). Possible solution is to [restart management agents](http://www.running-system.com/no-cpu-and-memory-usage-data-from-host-available-in-vcenter/) on the hosts.

```
Failed to add disk scsi0:2.
```

This error typically occurs when persistent disk is being attached to a second VM while it is attached to another VM. That may happen when first VM was not properly deleted and BOSH is no longer aware of its existence.

```
Could not acquire HTTP NFC lease, message is: 'A specified parameter was not correct.' fault cause is: '', fault message is: [], dynamic type is '', dynamic property is []'
```

The [vCenter docs](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vc-sdk/visdk41pubs/ApiReference/vim.vm.DefaultPowerOpInfo.html) show that the value should be `preset` rather than `default` inside the OVF file. Switching `powerOpInfo.*` properties resolved the problem.
