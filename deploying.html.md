Once referenced stemcells and releases are uploaded to the Director and the deployment manifest is complete, Director can successfull make a deployment. The CLI has a single command to create and update a deployment: [`bosh deploy` command](cli-v2.html#deploy). From the perspective of the Director same steps are taken to create or update a deployment.

To create a Zookeeper deployment from `zookeeper.yml` deployment manifest run the deploy command:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -e vbox -d zookeeper deploy zookeeper.yml
Using environment '192.168.56.6' as '?'
