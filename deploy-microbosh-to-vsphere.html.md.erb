title: Deploying MicroBOSH to vSphere
---

This topic explains how to deploy MicroBOSH to VMware vSphere.

<p class="note">Note: Micro CLI plugin is deprecated, but is still supported. To set up a new Director VM or upgrade your MicroBOSH, please follow <a href="./init-vsphere.html">Initializing on vSphere</a> document.</p>

##<a id="create-manifest"></a>Step 1: Create a Deployment Manifest ##

The MicroBOSH deployment manifest is a YAML file that defines the components and
properties of the deployment.
Create a manifest for your deployment as follows:

1. Create a local deployment directory to store your manifest.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ mkdir ~/my-micro-deployment
    </pre>

1. Create a deployment manifest YAML file.

    The example below is a MicroBOSH deployment manifest template.
    Copy and paste the template into a text editor and save the manifest to your
    deployment directory.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The example below has the file name
    <code>manifest.yml</code>, which we reference in other examples in this
    topic.</p>

```yaml

name: microbosh

network:
  type: manual
  ip:      10.0.0.6
  netmask: 255.255.255.0
  gateway: 10.0.0.1
  dns:     [10.0.0.2]
  cloud_properties:
    name: VSPHERE-NETWORK-NAME

      datacenters:
      - name: VSPHERE-DATACENTER-NAME
        vm_folder: VSPHERE-VMS-FOLDER-NAME
        template_folder: VSPHERE-TEMPLATES-FOLDER-NAME

        datastore_pattern: VSPHERE-DATASTORE-NAME
        persistent_datastore_pattern: VSPHERE-DATASTORE-NAME
        disk_path: VSPHERE-DISK-FOLDER-NAME
        allow_mixed_datastores: true

        clusters:
        - VSPHERE-CLUSTER-NAME

    agent:
      ntp: ["us.pool.ntp.org"]
```

##<a id="prepare"></a>Step 2: Prepare a vSphere Environment ##

To prepare your vSphere environment for deploying MicroBOSH, use the vSphere Web
Client to create any missing resources listed below:

- Replace `VCENTER-IP` (e.g. '192.168.0.10') with the IP of the vCenter.

- Replace `VCENTER-USER-NAME` (e.g. 'root') and `VCENTER-PASSWORD` (e.g. 'vmware') in your MicroBOSH deployment manifest with vCenter user name and password. BOSH does not require user to be an admin; however, it does need certain user privileges.

- Replace `VSPHERE-DATACENTER-NAME` (e.g. 'my-dc') with the name of the datacenter the Director will use for VM creation.

- Replace `VSPHERE-VMS-FOLDER-NAME` (e.g. 'my-micro-vms') and `VSPHERE-TEMPLATES-FOLDER-NAME` (e.g. 'my-micro-templates') with the name of the folder created to hold VMs and the name of the folder created to hold stemcells. Create both folders under the chosen datacenter.

- Replace `VSPHERE-DATASTORE-NAME` (e.g. 'datastore1') with the name of the datastore the Director will use for storing VMs and associated persistent disks.

- Replace `VSPHERE-DISK-FOLDER-NAME` (e.g. 'my-micro-disks') with the name of the VMs folder. Create disk folder in the chosen datastore from the datastore's browser.

- Replace `VSPHERE-CLUSTER-NAME` (e.g. 'cluster1') with the name of the vSphere cluster. Create cluster under the chosen datacenter in the Clusters tab.

- Replace `VSPHERE-NETWORK-NAME` (e.g. 'VM Network') with the name of the vSphere network. Create network under the chosen datacenter in the Networks tab.

## <a id="download-stemcell"></a>Step 3: Download a Stemcell ##

1. Open [https://bosh.io/stemcells](https://bosh.io/stemcells) in a web browser
to view a list of publicly available BOSH stemcells.
The list displays the most recent build numbers of BOSH stemcells, organized by operating system, target IaaS, and hypervisor.

1. Choose a BOSH stemcell for vSphere and click the build number to download.

## <a id="deploy"></a>Step 4: Deploy MicroBOSH ##

1. In a terminal window, run `bosh micro deployment microbosh.yml` from your
deployment directory to instruct MicroBOSH to use your manifest file.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ cd ~/my-micro-deployment
    $ bosh micro deployment manifest.yml
    WARNING! Your target has been changed to https://54.86.66.111:25555!
    Deployment set to ~/my-micro-deployment/manifest.yml
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: BOSH displays a red
      <code>WARNING!</code> message. This is not an error message.
      The message alerts you to a change in the targeted IP address.</p>

1. Run `bosh micro deploy STEMCELL-NAME` to deploy MicroBOSH.

      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: BOSH may displays a red
      <code>No bosh-deployments.yml file found</code> message.
      If prompted to allow MicroBOSH to the save state in the current directory,
      type <code>yes</code>.</p>

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ bosh micro deploy bosh-stemcell-3012-vsphere-esxi-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz

    No 'bosh-deployments.yml' file found in current directory.

    Is ~/my-micro-deployment a directory where you can save state? (type 'yes' to continue): yes

    Deploying new micro BOSH instance ~/my-micro-deployment/manifest.yml to 'https://10.0.0.6:25555' (type 'yes' to continue): yes

      Started deploy micro bosh
      ...
      Done deploy micro bosh

    Deployed '~/my-micro-deployment/manifest.yml' to 'https://10.0.0.6:25555', took 00:04:51 to complete
    </pre>

1. Use `bosh target 10.0.0.6` to log into your new BOSH Director. The default username and password are `admin` and `admin`.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh target 10.0.0.6
    Target set to 'microbosh'
    Your username: admin
    Enter password: *****
    Logged in as 'admin'

    $ bosh vms
    No deployments
    </pre>

## <a id="troubleshooting"></a>Basic Troubleshooting ##

If the deployment fails, run `bosh micro delete`, then deploy again.

If an error message displays 'Cannot log into vCenter', check the accuracy of the VCENTER-USER-NAME and VCENTER-PASSWORD in the deployment manifest.

If other error messages appear:

* Check your `microbosh.yml` for errors.
* Review your vSphere configuration.
