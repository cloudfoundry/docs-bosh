If you're using OpenStack Liberty or Mitaka, you cannot use SSH keys generated by nova with BOSH CLI [due to an OpenStack bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1483132). OpenStack versions before Liberty and after Mitaka are not affected. As a workaround, [generate your ssh key manually](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#generating-a-new-ssh-key) and import it to nova.


## VM Creation Failed

>     Bosh::Clouds::VMCreationFailed

This error is raised if OpenStack is unable to create a VM. That may happen because:

- not enough resources (vCPUs, RAM, disk) to run the VM. For example if you have selected `m1.xlarge` flavor that uses 10 vCPUs and you have 4 hypervisors and each one of them only has 3 vCPUs available, OpenStack is unable to start the VM anywhere even though, total vCPUs across all hypervisors is more than enough.


## Image Not Found

>     Image `4c1d6840-6ac7-4b42-bf29-c95fef6d986e' not found

It's possible that image was deleted from OpenStack directly and BOSH is not aware of it. You can recover with `bosh upload stemcell X --fix` to reupload the stemcell.
