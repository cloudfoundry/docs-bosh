# Community

BOSH is part of the open-source community, so you can easily find us in a few places...


## Slack

The [Cloud Foundry Slack](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com) is a great place to ask questions or discuss issues - especially if you are still trying to figure out what might actually be wrong. Contributors, operators, and developers of BOSH are typically hanging out in the [`#bosh`](https://cloudfoundry.slack.com/messages/C02HPPYQ2/) channel and happy to help answer questions.

!!! info "Slack Invitation"
    Slack requires members to be invited, so please [request an invite](https://slack.cloudfoundry.org/) from our bot first if you are new to the community.


## GitHub

BOSH is open source, so you can find most of the code in either the [`cloudfoundry`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry) or [`cloudfoundry-incubator`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator) GitHub organizations. If you are looking for a repository to start with, [`cloudfoundry/bosh`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh) is a great place to start.

Since BOSH is a larger project, there are quite a few repositories for the various components. If you are not sure which repository is best to discuss an issue or make a change, please feel free to ask! [Slack](#slack) usually works best for that, but you can also just [create an issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/issues/new) if that's easier.


## Roadmap

We use [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/) for keeping track of what we're working on and prioritizing tasks. We have several projects, but our main project is [CF BOSH](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/956238). For an aggregated view of all our projects, check out [bosh-stories](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-stories) to see a quick summary of our recent and upcoming work.


## Mailing List

If you prefer mailing lists, you can find us through the [`cf-bosh` mailing list](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/g/cf-bosh). Although it is quieter than [Slack](#slack), the community is usually able to help answer questions raised on the list. We also occasionally use this for announcements or product discussion.
