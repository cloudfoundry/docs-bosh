!!! note
    Updated for bosh-warden-cpi v28+.

This topic describes cloud properties for different resources created by the Warden/Garden CPI.

## AZs {: #azs }

Currently the CPI does not support any cloud properties for AZs.

Example:

```yaml
azs:
- name: z1
```

---
## Networks {: #networks }

Currently the CPI does not support any cloud properties for networks.

Example of a manual network:

```yaml
networks:
- name: default
  type: manual
  subnets:
  - range: 10.244.1.0/24
    gateway: 10.244.1.0
    static: [10.244.1.34]
```

!!! note
    bosh-warden-cpi v24+ makes it possible to use subnets bigger than /30 as exemplified above. bosh-lite v9000.48.0 uses that newer bosh-warden-cpi.

Example of a dynamic network:

```yaml
networks:
- name: default
  type: dynamic
```

The CPI does not support vip networks.

## VM Types / VM Extensions {: #resource-pools }

Schema for `cloud_properties` section:

* **ports** [Array, optional]: Allows to define port mapping between host and associated containers. Available in v30+.
  * **host** [String, required]: Port or range of ports. Example: `80`.
  * **container** [String, optional]: Port or range of ports. Defaults to `host` defined port or range. Example: `80`.
  * **protocol** [String, optional]: Connection protocol. Defaults to `tcp`. Example: `udp`.

We may add simple load balancing via iptables for testing if ports is forwarded to multiple containers.

Example:

```yaml
vm_extensions:
- name: external-access
  cloud_properties:
    ports:
    # Forward 80 to 80 tcp
    - host: 80
    # Forward 443 to 8443 tcp
    - host: 443
      container: 8443
    # Forward 53 to 53 udp
    - host: 53
      protocol: udp
    # Forward 1000-2000 to 1000-2000 tcp
    - host: 1000-2000
```

---
## Disk Types {: #disk-pools }

Currently the CPI does not support any cloud properties for disks.

Example of 10GB disk:

```yaml
disk_pools:
- name: default
  disk_size: 10_240
```

---
## Global Configuration {: #global }

The CPI uses containers to represent VMs and loopback devices to represent disks. Since the CPI can only talk to a single Garden server it can only manage resources on a single machine.

Example of a CPI configuration:

```yaml
properties:
  warden_cpi:
    loopback_range: [100, 130]
    warden:
      connect_network: tcp
      connect_address: 127.0.0.1:7777
    actions:
      stemcells_dir: "/var/vcap/data/cpi/stemcells"
      disks_dir: "/var/vcap/store/cpi/disks"
      host_ephemeral_bind_mounts_dir: "/var/vcap/data/cpi/ephemeral_bind_mounts_dir"
      host_persistent_bind_mounts_dir: "/var/vcap/data/cpi/persistent_bind_mounts_dir"
    agent:
      mbus: nats://nats:((nats_password))@10.244.8.2:4222
      blobstore:
        provider: dav
        options:
          endpoint: http://10.244.8.2:25251
          user: agent
          password: ((blobstore_agent_password))
```

## Example Cloud Config {: #cloud-config }

## Notes {: #notes }

* Garden server does not have a UI; however, you can use [gaol CLI](https://github.com/xoebus/gaol) to interact with it directly.
