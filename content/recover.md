!!! note
    Requires director v277.4.0 and CLI v7.3.0

BOSH provides the `create-recovery-plan` and `recover` CLI commands to repair
IaaS resources used by a specific deployment. The underlying machinery is very
similar to [Cloud Check](cck.md), with several exceptions:

1. There is a 2-step process: `create-recovery-plan` scans the deployment for
   problems and then prompts the user to generate a recovery plan, which is
   saved to a file.  The `recover` command consumes that file.
2. Resolutions to problems are selected by instance group and problem type.
   The `cloud-check` command asks for a resolution for each particular
   problem.
3. When generating a recovery plan, `max_in_flight` can be overridden per
   instance group.  This can be handy to speed deployment recovery.  The
   `cloud-check` command uses the `max_in_flight` values in the deployment
   manfiest.


Otherwise, the types of [problems](cck.md#problems) and the mechanism by which
they are repaired are the same as in the `cloud-check` command.


## Creating a recovery plan {: #create-recovery-plan }

To create a recovery plan, invoke the  `bosh create-recovery-plan` command like:

```shell
bosh create-recovery-plan recovery-plan.yml
```

### Recovery plan {: #recovery-plan }

Each recovery plan has the following schema:

**instance_groups_plan** [Array, required]: The name of instance groups in the deployment to recover.

* **max_in_flight_override** [Integer or Percentage, optional]: The `max_in_flight` value to use for problem resolution in the given instance group.
* **planned_resolutions** [Hash, optional]: Specifies which resolution to pick per problem type.  Example: `{missing_vm: recreate_vm_without_wait, unresponsive_agent: reboot}`

Here is an example of a complete recovery plan, generated from the above session:

```yaml
instance_groups_plan:
- name: cloud_controller_ng
  planned_resolutions:
    missing_vm: recreate_vm_without_wait
    unresponsive_agent: reboot_vm
- name: diego_cell
  max_in_flight_override: "3"
  planned_resolutions:
    missing_vm: recreate_vm_without_wait
    mount_info_mismatch: reattach_disk_and_reboot
- name: router
  max_in_flight_override: 100%
  planned_resolutions:
    missing_vm: recreate_vm_without_wait
    unresponsive_agent: reboot_vm
```

## Applying a recovery plan {: #recover }

Using the recovery plan above, invoking `bosh recover` looks like:

```shell
bosh recover recovery-plan.yml
```
