!!! note
    This feature is available with bosh-release v255.4+.

The Director has a way to specify global configuration for all VMs in all deployments. The runtime config is a YAML file that defines IaaS agnostic configuration that applies to all deployments.

---
## Updating and retrieving runtime config {: #update }

To update runtime config on the Director use [`bosh update-runtime-config`](sysadmin-commands.md#cloud-config) CLI command.

!!! note
    See [example runtime config](#example) below.

```shell
bosh update-runtime-config runtime.yml
bosh runtime-config
```

```text
Acting as user 'admin' on 'micro'

releases:
- name: strongswan
  version: 6.0.0

addons:
- name: security
  jobs:
  - name: strongswan
    release: strongswan

tags:
  business_unit: marketing
  email_contact: ops@marketing.co.com
```

Once runtime config is updated all deployments will be considered outdated. `bosh deployments` does not currently show that but we have plans to show that information. The Director will apply runtime config changes to each deployment during the next `bosh deploy` for that deployment.

## Example {: #example }

```yaml
releases:
- name: strongswan
  version: 6.0.0

addons:
- name: security

    properties:
      strongswan:
        ca_cert: ...

tags:

!!! note
    To remove all addons, specify empty arrays as follows:

```yaml
releases: []
addons: []
```

## Addons Block {: #addons }

Operators typically want to ensure that certain software runs on all VMs managed by the Director. Examples of such software are:

- security agents like Tripwire, IPsec, etc.
- anti-viruses like McAfee
- custom health monitoring agents like Datadog
- logging agents like Loggregator's Metron

An addon is a release job that is colocated on all VMs managed by the Director.

**addons** [Array, optional]: Specifies the [addons](terminology.md#addon) to be applied to all deployments.

* **name** [String, required]: A unique name used to identify and reference the addon.
* **jobs** [Array of hashes, requires]: Specifies the name and release of release jobs to be colocated.
    * **name** [String, required]: The job name.
    * **release** [String, required]: The release where the job exists.
    * **properties** [Hash, optional]: Specifies job properties. Properties allow the Director to configure jobs to a specific environment.
* **include** [Hash, optional]: Specifies inclusion [placement rules](#placement-rules) Available in bosh-release v260+.
* **exclude** [Hash, optional]: Specifies exclusion [placement rules](#placement-rules). Available in bosh-release v260+.

### Placement Rules for `include` and `exclude` Directives {: #placement-rules }

Available rules:

* **stemcell** [Array of hashes, optional]: at least one of the items must match
    * **os** [String, required]: Matches stemcell's operating system. Example: `ubuntu-xenial`
* **deployments** [Array of strings, optional]: Matches based on deployment names.
* **jobs** [Array of hashes, optional]: at least one of the configured jobs must match
    * **name** [String, required]: Matching job name.
    * **release** [String, required]: Matching release name.
* **instance_groups** [Array of strings, optional]: Matches based on instance group names. Available in bosh-release v268+.
* **lifecycle** [String, optional]: Matches based on lifecycle type, either `service` or `errand`. Note that a service VM is any non-errand VM and that colocated errands may actually run on service VMs. Available in bosh-release v262+.
* **networks** [Array of strings, optional]: Matches based on network names. Available in bosh-release v262+.
* **teams** [Array of strings, optional]: Matches based on team names. Available in bosh-release v253+.

Example:

```yaml
addons:
- name: security
  jobs:
  - name: strongswan
    release: strongswan
    properties:
      strongswan:
        ca_cert: ...
  - name: syslog_drain
    release: syslog
    properties:
      syslog_drain_ips: [10.10.0.20]
  include:
    deployments: [dep1, dep2]
```

Example with `include` rules:

```yaml
include:
  deployments: [dep1, dep2]
  jobs:
  - name: redis
    release: redis-release
  stemcell:
  - os: ubuntu-xenial
```

See [common addons list](addons-common.md) for several examples.

#### Precedent for Placement Rules

Placement rules are chosen based on the AND operator; specifically, the director
will chose applicability if the specified rule is in the `include` directive AND the
rule is NOT in the `exclude` directive.

The rules inside a directive are also based on the AND operator; if the VM
meets the criteria of all of the rules, it will be considered `included` or
`excluded`. All items within the arrays in an inclusion/exclusion rule use the OR operator.


For example, given the following config:

```yaml
addons:
- name: my-addon
  jobs:
  - name: my-addon-job
    release: my-addon-release
    properties:
      ...
  include:
    lifecycle: errand
    stemcell:
    - os: ubuntu-xenial
    - os: windows2019
  exclude:
    jobs:
    - job1
    deployments:
    - dep1
    - dep2

```

The director will collocate `my-addon` to all errand VMs that use either the `ubuntu-xenial` or `windows2019` stemcells,
except for any VMs with `job1` belonging to deployment `dep1` or `dep2`.

In pseudocode:

```
  AND (
    INCLUDE (
      AND (
        OR (
          stemcell:ubuntu-xenial
          stemcell:windows2019
        )
        lifecycle:errand
      )
    )
    EXCLUDE (
      AND (
        jobs:job1
        OR (
          deployments:dep1
          deployments:dep2
        )
      )
    )
  )
```

## Tags Block {: #tags }

**tags** [Hash, optional]: Specifies key value pairs to be sent to the CPI for VM tagging. Combined with deployment level tags during the deploy. Available in bosh-release v260+.

Both VMs and disks get tagged by these custom tags.

For VMs, the `director`, `deployment`, `instance_group`, `job`, `id`, `name`,
`index` and `created_at` are default tags enforced by Bosh that cannot be
overridden. See also the [`set_vm_metadata` CPI method](cpi-api-v2-method/set-vm-metadata.md)
for more info about those default tags.

For disks, the `director`, `deployment`, `instance_group`, `instance_id`,
`instance_index` and `attached_at` are default Bosh tags that cannot be
overridden. See  the [`set_disk_metadata` CPI method](cpi-api-v2-method/set-disk-metadata.md)
for more info about those.

For stemcells, those uploaded after setting the tags, will receive the new tags.

Example:

```yaml
addons:
- name: my-addon
  jobs:
  - name: my-addon-job
    release: my-addon-release
    properties:
      ...
tags:
  business_unit: marketing
  email_contact: ops@marketing.co.com
```
