# detach_disk

Detaches disk from the VM.

If the persistent disk is attached to a VM that will be deleted, it's more likely `delete_vm` CPI method will be called without a call to `detach_disk` with an expectation that `delete_vm` will make sure disks are disassociated from the VM upon its deletion.

Agent settings should have been updated to remove information about given disk.


## Arguments
