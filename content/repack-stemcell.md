    Applies to CLI v2 v2.0.12+.

The [CLI v2](cli-v2.md) includes a command to repack stemcells; this enables limited customization of a stemcell including the following:

- name
- version
- cloud properties

---
## Syntax {: #syntax }

```shell
$ bosh repack-stemcell src.tgz dst.tgz [--name=new_name] [--version=new_version] [--cloud-properties=json-string]
```

## Examples {: #examples }

In this example, we first download the stemcell we plan to modify, and then we create a new stemcell that's identical to the one we downloaded with the exception of a new name (`acme-corporation-stemcell`):

```shell
$ curl -OL https://s3.amazonaws.com/bosh-gce-light-stemcells/light-bosh-stemcell-3363.9-google-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz
$ bosh repack-stemcell --name=acme-corporation-stemcell light-bosh-stemcell-3363.9-google-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz acme-corporation-stemcell.tgz
```

We decide to change the stemcell version number to `100` as well as the name (note: this does not change the stemcell version in the `/var/vcap/bosh/etc/stemcell_version` file in the root filesystem of the stemcell):

```shell
$ bosh repack-stemcell --name=acme-corporation-stemcell --version=100 light-bosh-stemcell-3363.9-google-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz acme-corporation-stemcell.tgz
```

When we've uploaded the stemcell and we run `bosh stemcells`, we will see our stemcell listed with the new name and new version.

## CPI-Specific Options {: #cpi_specific }

### AWS CPI-Specific Options {: #aws_cpi_specific }

The `repack-stemcell` command can be used to enable the encryption of the root filesystem of VMs deployed with the repacked stemcell..

Two arguments enable the encryption of the root filesystem:

* **encrypted** [Boolean, optional]: Must be set to `true` if encryption of the root filesystem
* **kms\_key\_arn** [String, optional]: Created in the [Encryption Keys](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#encryptionKeys) section of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) console. If not specified _and_ `encrypted` is true, the root filesystem will be encrypted with the default key.

We modify the cloud-properties of an AWS stemcell to encrypt the root filesystem of instances deployed with our repacked stemcell. The cloud-properties must be specified as valid JSON. This only works with heavy stemcells:

We take this opportunity to rename our stemcell so that we don't accidently confuse the unencrypted stemcells with the encrypted stemcells.

```shell
$ bosh repack-stemcell --name=acme-ubuntu-encrypted --cloud-properties='{"encrypted": true, "kms_key_arn": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:088444384256:key/4ffbe966-d138-4f4d-a077-4c234d05b3b1"}' bosh-stemcell-3363.9-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz acme-encrypted-stemcell.tgz
```

!!! note
    Available in BOSH AWS CPI v63+.

The cloud properties will be merged with the existing cloud properties. It won't delete any properties, but it will overwrite the ones specified. For example, the above command will not delete the stemcell's cloud-property `infrastructure: aws`.

## Technical Details {: #technical_details }

The `repack-stemcell` works by modifying the stemcell manifest file (`stemcell.MF`) located within the stemcell tarball. It does not modify any other aspect of the stemcell. For example, it will not make any change to the root partition (it won't add new users or new packages). It does not modify the filesystem image.

The stemcell's manifest may be examined by extracting the `stemcell.MF` file from the stemcell tarball:

```shell
$ curl -L https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-google-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent | tar -Oxvf - -- stemcell.MF
