# Amazon Web Services

The `aws` CPI can be used with [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

## Concepts

The following table maps BOSH concepts to their AWS-native equivalents.

| BOSH | Amazon Web Services |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| Availability Zone | [Availability Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html) |
| Virtual Machine | [EC2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Instances.html) |
| VM Config Metadata | BOSH Registry |
| Network Subnet | [VPC Subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html) |
| Virtual IP | [EC2 Elastic IP](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) |
| Persistent Disk | [EC2 EBS Volume](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumes.html) |
| Disk Snapshot | [EC2 EBS Snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html) |
| Stemcell | [EC2 Amazon Machine Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) |


## Feature Support

The following sections describe some specific BOSH features supported by the CPI.


### Network

The CPI does not support multiple NICs being attached to a VM.

| Network Type | Support |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Manual | Single network per instance |
| Dynamic | Single network per instance |
| VIP | Single network per instance |


### Encryption

AWS supports encryption functionality through their [Key Management Service](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) using both IaaS-managed or customer-managed keys. The `encrypted` and `kms_key_arn` settings can be set globally, or for specific disks and stemcells, to configure encryption settings.

| Platform | Disk Type | Encryption | Customer-managed Keys |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Linux | Root Disk | Supported, [v69](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-aws-cpi-release/releases/tag/v69)+ | Supported |
| Linux | Ephemeral Disk | Supported, [v69](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-aws-cpi-release/releases/tag/v69)+ | Supported |
| Linux | Persistent Disk | Supported, [v69](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-aws-cpi-release/releases/tag/v69)+ | Supported |
| Windows | Root Disk | Partially Supported (manual steps required) | Supported |
| Windows | Ephemeral Disk | Not Supported | n/a |
| Windows | Persistent Disk | Not Supported | n/a |

**Key Rotation** - since the CPI does not have insight into keys being rotated within AWS Console or `aws` CLI commands, it is typically easiest to rotate keys by provisioning a new key and updating cloud properties to refer to the new ARN. Since cloud properties for a disk change, BOSH will create a new disk using the new key and migrate data onto the new disk.


### Miscellaneous

| Feature   | Support |
| --------- | ------- |
| Multi-CPI | Supported, [v61](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-aws-cpi-release/releases/tag/v61)+ |
| Native Disk Resize | Not Supported |
