# Stemcell OS: Microsoft Windows Server

The Microsoft Windows images are built from the
[cloudfoundry/stembuild](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/stembuild)
repository. Previously, they were built from
[cloudfoundry/bosh-windows-stemcell-builder](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-windows-stemcell-builder)
(deprecated).

## Distributions

### Windows Server 2019

You can find the official stemcells from
[bosh.io/stemcells](https://bosh.io/stemcells#windows2019).

## Licensing

Windows stemcells will have additional costs associated with Microsoft
licensing; they do not include actual Windows OS. When using light stemcells
on public clouds, additional costs will be associated with your virtual
machine. For more information on building Windows stemcells and running in
on-premise environments, please see this [Creating a Windows Stemcell for
vSphere Using stembuild](./windows-stemcell-create.md) and [Getting
Started](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-windows-stemcell-builder/wiki/BOSH-Windows-Getting-Started-Guide)
(deprecated) guide.
