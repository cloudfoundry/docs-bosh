!!! note
    Applies to CLI v2.

It's typically necessary to separate passwords, certificates, S3 bucket names etc. from YAML documents used with CLI commands such as `bosh create-env` and `bosh deploy`. Even though the structure of a YAML document (manifest) does not change these values are typically different. CLI provides special syntax in YAML documents to annotate such values making plain YAML document into a parameterized template.

!!! note
    Changing structure of a YAML document such as adding an S3 access configuration section is a bit more than just YAML document parameterization. Look into [operations files](cli-ops-files.md) for additional details.

##  Variables {: #variables }

Variables provide a way to define parameters for a YAML document. Each variable has a value, one or more reference locations and an optional type and generation options.

### Implicit declaration {: #implicit }

Following example shows how to add two variables to a YAML document (`base.yml`):

```yaml
s3_access_key_id: ((access_key_id))
s3_access_secret_key: ((access_secret_key))
```

`access_key_id` and `access_secret_key` variables are implicitly defined just by being present within double parentheses. By parameterizing above YAML document it can now be used as a template.

### Value sources {: #value-sources }

Commands that accept YAML documents such as `bosh deploy` and `bosh update-cloud-config` typically have a set of flags that can be used to provide variable values. `bosh interpolate` command can be used to experiment with such flags as its only job is to print result of variable interpolation.

!!! note
    Once Director officially supports config server API, it will be recommended to use connected config server to store variable values instead of providing them via CLI flags.

CLI allows to provide variable values via usage of one or more of the following flags:

- `--var=key=val` (`-v`) flag sets single variable value as an argument

    ```shell
    bosh interpolate base.yml -v access_key_id=some-key -v access_secret_key=some-secret
    # s3_access_key_id: some-key
    # s3_access_secret_key: some-secret
    ```

- `--var-file=key=path` flag sets single variable value as an entire file

    ```shell
    cat 1.txt
    # some-key

    cat 2.txt
    # some-secret

    bosh interpolate base.yml --var-file access_key_id=1.txt --var-file access_secret_key=2.txt
    # s3_access_key_id: some-key
    # s3_access_secret_key: some-secret
    ```

- `--vars-file=path` (`-l`) flag sets file that contains multiple variable values

    ```shell
    cat secrets.yml
    # access_key_id: some-key
    # access_secret_key: some-secret

    bosh interpolate base.yml -l secrets.yml
    # s3_access_key_id: some-key
    #s3_access_secret_key: some-secret
    ```

- via [`--vars-store=path` flag](#vars-store) flag sets file that contains multiple variable values (with a possibility that missing variables will be automatically generated)

- `--vars-env=prefix` flag sets variable values found in prefixed environment variables (casing is important)

    ```shell
    export FOO_access_key_id=some-key
    export FOO_access_secret_key=some-secret

    bosh interpolate base.yml --vars-env FOO
    # s3_access_key_id: some-key
    # s3_access_secret_key: some-secret
    ```

Here is a more realistic example of using base YAML document (`bosh.yml`) from [cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment) and specifying several variables and operations files to provide necessary missing values:

```shell
bosh create-env ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/bosh.yml \
  --state state.json \
  --vars-store ./creds.yml
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/virtualbox/cpi.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/virtualbox/outbound-network.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/bosh-lite.yml \
  -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/jumpbox-user.yml \
  -v director_name=vbox \
  -v internal_ip=192.168.56.6 \
  -v internal_gw=192.168.56.1 \
  -v internal_cidr=192.168.56.0/24 \
  -v network_name=vboxnet0 \
  -v outbound_network_name=NatNetwork
```

### Explicit declaration {: #explicit }

In addition to just implicitly declaring variables it may be useful to explicitly declare them and provide additional details about used variables so that either the CLI or the Director (actually connected config server) can validate, automatically store and generate variable values.

Dedicated top level `variables` section exists where variable definitions are specified:

```yaml
variables:
- name: admin_password
  type: password
- name: postgres_password
  type: password
- name: default_ca
  type: certificate
  options:
    is_ca: true
    common_name: bosh-ca
- name: director_ssl
  type: certificate
  options:
    ca: default_ca
    common_name: ((internal_ip))
    alternative_names: [((internal_ip))]
```

A variable can define its type and generation options.

!!! note
    Variables generated by the director into a config server (typically credhub) are not deleted upon deletion of the associated bosh deployment. This feature protects important credentials from being deleted upon accidental deletion of a deployment (similarly to persistent disks). It might therefore be necessary to directly periodically clean up orphaned credhub credentials. Bosh does not support such clean up.


### `--vars-store` flag {: #vars-store }

`--vars-store=path` flag provides a read write value source unlike all other variables flags that provide read only source. It is able to lazily generate and save (to a given file location) variable values based on their type and options.

!!! note
    Once Director officially supports config server API, it will be recommended to avoid using `--vars-store` flag for all commands except `bosh create-env`. `bosh create-env` command will not be able to use config server API since it most likely will be deploying a config server alongside the Director.

Currently CLI supports `certificate`, `password`, `rsa`, and `ssh` types. The Director (connected to a config server) may support additional types known by the config server.

See [Variable Types](variable-types.md) for details on variable generation.

```shell
cat base.yml
```

```yaml
pass: ((admin_password))
variables:
- name: admin_password
  type: password
```

```shell
bosh interpolate base.yml --vars-store=creds.yml
# pass: vbvdhjbzqelnq7cfyw09

cat creds.yml
# admin_password: vbvdhjbzqelnq7cfyw09
```

### Absolute Path Variables {: #absolute }

When deploying, bosh will reference and store variables internally, following the convention `/director_name/deployment_name/variable_name`, this defines the _absolute path_ that allows for BOSH to unequivocally identify a variable.

This can be leveraged to allow the operator to share (or reuse) a variable on subsequent deployments, providing it as the `name` of an [explicitly declared variable](#explicit).

For example, given a director named `main`, having a deployment named `test` with one variable named `identity-credentials`, the variable can be (re)used in future changes to the deployment, by referencing `/main/test/identity-credentials` as the `name` of the variable:

```yaml
variables:
- name: /main/test/identity-credentials
  options:
    ca: /main/test/identity-credentials-ca
    common_name: Identity Credentials Intermediate CA
    duration: 730
    is_ca: true
    key_usage:
    - key_cert_sign
  type: certificate
```

!!!warning
    Variables can be referenced between deployments using their absolute path, however this is strongly discouraged and unsupported. BOSH provides a robust and preferred way to share properties between deployments, via [Links](links.md).
