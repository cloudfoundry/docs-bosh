!!! note
    This feature is available with bosh-release v255.4+.

!!! warning
    If you are using director version between v241 and v256, once you opt into using cloud config all deployments must be converted to use new format. If you want to deploy both v1 and v2 manifests, update to director v257+.

The deployment manifest is a YAML file that defines the components and properties of the deployment. When an operator initiates a new deployment using the CLI, the Director receives a manifest and creates or updates a deployment with matching name.

Assuming that you are using [cloud config](cloud-config.md), your deployment manifest is expected to have:

* [Deployment Identification](#deployment): A name for the deployment and the UUID of the Director managing the deployment
* [Features Block](#features): Opts into Director features to be used in this deployment
* [Releases Block](#releases): Name and version of each release in a deployment
* [Stemcells Block](#stemcells): Name and version of each stemcell in a deployment
* [Update Block](#update): Defines how BOSH updates instances during deployment
* [Instance Groups Block](#instance-groups): Configuration and resource information for instance groups
* [Addons](#addons): Configures deployment specific addons
* [Properties Block](#properties): Describes global properties and generalized configuration information
* [Variables Block](#variables): Variables configuration
* [Tags Block](#tags): Sets additional tags for the deployment

---
## Deployment Identification {: #deployment }

**name** [String, required]: The name of the deployment. A single Director can manage multiple deployments and distinguishes them by name.

**director_uuid** [String, required]: Not required by CLI v2. This string must match the UUID of the currently targeted Director for the CLI to allow any operations on the deployment. Use `bosh status` to display the UUID of the currently targeted Director.

Example:

```yaml
name: my-redis
```

---
## Features Block {: #features }

**features** [Hash, options]: Specifies Director features that should be used within this deployment.

* **converge\_variables** [Boolean, optional]: Enable variables to be regenerated by the backend config server (e.g. [CredHub](https://credhub-api.cfapps.io/#overwriting-credential-values)) when the variable `options` change. Default `false`. Available in bosh-release 267+.
* **randomize\_az\_placement** [Boolean, optional]: Randomizes AZs for left over instances that cannot be distributed equally between AZs. For example, given an instance group with 5 instances and only 3 AZs, 1 remaining instance will be placed in randomly chosen AZ out of specified 3 AZs. Available in bosh-release 264+.
* **use\_dns\_addresses** [Boolean, optional]: Enables or disables returning of DNS addresses in links. Defaults to global Director `use_dns_addresses` configuration.

Example:

```yaml
features:
  use_dns_addresses: true
```

---
## Releases Block {: #releases }

**releases** [Array, required]: The name and version of each release in the deployment.

* **name** [String, required]: Name of a release used in the deployment.
* **version** [String, required]: The version of the release to use. Version can be `latest`.
* **url** [String, optional]: URL of a release to download. Works with CLI v2. Example: `https://bosh.io/d/github.com/cloudfoundry/syslog-release?v=11`.
* **sha1** [String, optional]: SHA1 of asset referenced via URL. Works with CLI v2. Example: `332ac15609b220a3fdf5efad0e0aa069d8235788`.

See [Release URLs](release-urls.md) for more details.

Example:

```yaml
releases:
- name: redis
  version: 12
```

Example with a URL:

```yaml
releases:
- name: concourse
  version: 3.3.2
  url: https://bosh.io/d/github.com/concourse/concourse?v=3.3.2
  sha1: 2c876303dc6866afb845e728eab58abae8ff3be2
```

---
## Stemcells Block {: #stemcells }

**stemcells** [Array, required]: The name and version of each stemcell in the deployment.

* **alias** [String, required]: Name of a stemcell used in the deployment
* **os** [String, optional]: Operating system of a matching stemcell. Example: `ubuntu-trusty`.
* **version** [String, required]: The version of a matching stemcell. Version can be `latest`.
* **name** [String, optional]: Full name of a matching stemcell. Either `name` or `os` keys can be specified.

Note: `url` key is not supported in stemcells block because there is no single stemcell that works on all IaaSes. Since we want to keep deployment manifests decoupled from any cloud specific declarations we do not allow specifying URL.

Example:

```yaml
stemcells:
- alias: default
  os: ubuntu-trusty
  version: 3147
- alias: default2
  name: bosh-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
  version: 3149
```

---
## Update Block {: #update }

**update** [Hash, required]: This specifies instance update properties. These properties control how BOSH updates instances during the deployment.

* **canaries** [Integer, required]: The number of [canary](terminology.md#canary) instances.
* **max\_in\_flight** [Integer or Percentage, required]: The maximum number of non-canary instances to update in parallel within an availability zone.
* **canary\_watch\_time** [Integer or Range, required]: Only applies to monit start operation.
    * If the `canary_watch_time` is an integer, the Director sleeps for that many milliseconds, then checks whether the canary instances are healthy.
    * If the `canary_watch_time` is a range (low-high), the Director:
        * Waits for `low` milliseconds
        * Waits until instances are healthy or `high` milliseconds have passed since instances started updating
* **update\_watch\_time** [Integer or Range, required]: Only applies to monit start operation.
    * If the `update_watch_time` is an integer, the Director sleeps for that many milliseconds, then checks whether the instances are healthy.
    * If the `update_watch_time` is a range (low-high), the Director:
        * Waits for `low` milliseconds
        * Waits until instances are healthy or `high` milliseconds have passed since instances started updating
* **serial** [Boolean, optional]: If disabled (set to `false`), instance groups will be deployed in parallel, otherwise - sequentially. Instances within a group will still follow `canary` and `max_in_flight` configuration. Defaults to `true`.
* **vm_strategy** [String, optional]: Influence how instances are updated when their VM needs to be recreated due to IaaS-related changes. Choose from one of the following strategies. Defaults to `delete-create`. Introduced in [bosh/267.2](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/releases/tag/v267.2).
    * `delete-create` - fully stop processes and delete the VM before creating and provisioning a new VM.
    * `create-swap-delete` - create and provision a new VM before stopping processes and transferring responsibilities from the old VM. Some configurations (e.g. static IPs) are not supported and will automatically revert to the `delete-create` strategy.

See [job lifecycle](job-lifecycle.md) for more details on startup/shutdown procedure within each VM.

Example:

```yaml
update:
  canaries: 1
  max_in_flight: 10
  canary_watch_time: 1000-30000
  update_watch_time: 1000-30000
```

* **migrated_from** [Array, optional]: Specific migration settings for this instance group. Use this to [rename and/or migrate instance groups](migrated-from.md).
* **lifecycle** [String, optional]: Specifies the kind of workload the instance group represents. Valid values are `service` and `errand`; defaults to `service`. A `service` runs indefinitely and restarts if it fails. An `errand` starts with a manual trigger and does not restart if it fails.

        * **swap\_size** [Integer, optional]: Size of swap partition in MB to create. Set this to 0 to avoid having a swap partition created. Default: RAM size of used VM type up to half of the ephemeral disk size.
        * **ipv6** [Hash, optional]:
            * **enable** [Boolean, optional]: Force IPv6 enabled in kernel (this configuration is not necessary if one of the VM addresses is IPv6). Default: `false`.
