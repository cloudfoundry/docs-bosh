This topic describes cloud properties for different resources created by the Azure CPI.

## AZs {: #azs }

* **availability_zone** [String, optional]: Availability zone to use for creating instances (available in v33+). Possible values: `'1'`, `'2'`, `'3'`. Read this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview) to get regions and VM sizes on Azure that support availability zones. [More details about availability zone](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/tree/master/docs/advanced/availability-zone).

Example:

```yaml
azs:
- name: z1
  cloud_properties:
    availability_zone: '1'
```

---
## Networks {: #networks }

### Dynamic Network or Manual Network

Schema for `cloud_properties` section:

* **resource\_group\_name** [String, optional]: Name of a resource group. If it is set, Azure CPI will search the virtual network and security group in this resource group. Otherwise, Azure CPI will search the virtual network and security group in `resource_group_name` in the global CPI settings.
* **virtual\_network\_name** [String, required]: Name of a virtual network. Example: `boshnet`.
* **subnet_name** [String, required]: Name of a subnet within virtual network.
* **security_group** [String, optional]: The [security group](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-nsg/) to apply to network interfaces of all VMs placed in this network. The security group of a network interface can be specified either in a VM type/extension (higher priority) or a network configuration (lower priority). If it's not specified in neither places, the default security group (specified by `default_security_group` in the global CPI settings) will be used.
* **application\_security\_groups** [Array, optional]: The [application security group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview#application-security-groups) to apply to network interfaces of all VMs placed in this network. The application security groups of a network interface can be specified either in a VM type/extension (higher priority) or a network configuration (lower priority).
    * This property is supported in v31+.
    * You must reference the [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/create-network-security-group-preview) to register your subscription with this new feature.
* **ip_forwarding** [Boolean, optional]: The flag to enable [ip forwarding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface#enable-or-disable-ip-forwarding) for network interfaces of all VMs placed in this network. The ip forwarding can be enabled/disabled either in a VM type/extension (higher priority) or a network configuration (lower priority). If it's not specified in neither places, the default value is `false`. Available in v35.3.0+.
* **accelerated_networking** [Boolean, optional]: The flag to enable [accelerated networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli) for network interfaces of all VMs placed in this network. The accelerated networking can be enabled/disabled either in a VM type/extension (higher priority) or a network configuration (lower priority). If it's not specified in neither places, the default value is `false`. Available in v35.4.0+. This feature needs ubuntu-xenial v81+ and [specific instance type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli#supported-vm-instances).

See [how to create a virtual network and subnets](azure-resources.md#virtual-network).

Example of manual network:

```yaml
networks:
- name: default
  type: manual
  subnets:
  - range: 10.10.0.0/24
    gateway: 10.10.0.1
    cloud_properties:
      resource_group_name: my-resource-group-name
      virtual_network_name: my-vnet-name
      subnet_name: my-subnet-name
      security_group: my-security-group-name
      application_security_groups: ["my-application-security-group-name-1", "my-application-security-group-name-2"]
      ip_forwarding: true
      accelerated_networking: true
```

### Vip Network

Schema for `cloud_properties` section:

* **resource\_group\_name** [String, optional]: Name of a resource group. If it is set, Azure CPI will search the public IP in this resource group. Otherwise, Azure CPI will search the public IP in `resource_group_name` in the global CPI settings.

See [how to create public IP](azure-resources.md#public-ips) to use with vip networks.

Example of vip network:

```yaml
networks:
- name: public
  type: vip
  cloud_properties:
    resource_group_name: my-resource-group
```

---
## VM Types / VM Extensions {: #resource-pools }

Schema for `cloud_properties` section:

* **instance_type** [String, required]: Type of the [instance](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/). Example: `Standard_A2`. [Basic Tier Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/basic-tier-virtual-machines-2/) should not be used if you need to bind the instance to Azure Load Balancer (ALB), because Basic Tier VM doesn't support ALB.
* **root_disk** [Hash, optional]: OS disk of custom size.
    * **size** [Integer, optional]: Specifies the disk size in MiB.
        * The size must be greater than 3 * 1024 and less than the max disk size for [unmanaged](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/unmanaged-disks/) or [managed](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/managed-disks/) disk. Please always use `N * 1024` as the size because Azure always uses GiB but not MiB.
        * It has a default value `30 * 1024` only when ephemeral_disk.use\_root\_disk is set to true.
* **caching** [String, optional]: Type of the disk caching of the VMs' OS disks. It can be either `None`, `ReadOnly` or `ReadWrite`. Default is `ReadWrite`.
* **ephemeral_disk** [Hash, optional]: Ephemeral disk to apply for all VMs that are in this VM type/extension. By default a data disk with the default size as below will be created as the ephemeral disk.
    * **use\_root\_disk** [Boolean, optional]: Enable to use OS disk to store the ephemeral data. The default value is false. When it is true, ephemeral_disk.size will not be used.
    * **size** [Integer, optional]: Specifies the disk size in MiB. If this is not set, the default size as below will be used. The size of the ephemeral disk for the BOSH VM should be larger than or equal to `30*1024` MiB. Please always use `N * 1024` as the size because Azure always uses GiB not MiB.
        * If the Azure temporary disk size for the instance type is less than `30*1024` MiB, the default size is `30*1024` MiB because the space may not be enough.
        * If the Azure temporary disk size for the instance type is larger than `1000*1024` MiB, the default size is `1000*1024` MiB because it is not expected to use such a large ephemeral disk in CF currently.
        * Otherwise, the Azure temporary disk size will be used as the default size. See more information about [Azure temporary disk size](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/).

* **load_balancer** [String, optional]: Name of a [load balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/load-balancer-overview/) the VMs should belong to. You need to create the load balancer manually before configuring it. Notes:
    * [Basic Tier Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/basic-tier-virtual-machines-2/) (Example: `Basic_A1`) doesn't support Azure Load Balancer.
    * If `availability_zone` is specified for the VM, [standard sku load balancer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-overview) must be used, as `basic sku load balancer` does not work for zone.
* **application_gateway** [String, optional]: Name of the [application gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-gateway/) which the VMs should be associated to.
    * This property is supported in CPI v28+.
    * You need to create the application gateway manually before configuring it. Please refer to [the guidance](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/tree/master/docs/advanced/application-gateway).
* **security_group** [String, optional]: The [security group](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-nsg/) to apply to network interfaces of all VMs who have this VM type/extension. The security group of a network interface can be specified either in a VM type/extension (higher priority) or a network configuration (lower priority). If it's not specified in neither places, the default security group (specified by `default_security_group` in the global CPI settings) will be used.
* **application\_security\_groups** [Array, optional]: The [application security group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview#application-security-groups) to apply to network interfaces of all VMs who have this VM type/extension. The application security groups of a network interface can be specified either in a VM type/extension (higher priority) or a network configuration (lower priority).
    * This property is supported in v31+.
    * You must reference the [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/create-network-security-group-preview) to register your subscription with this new feature.
* **ip_forwarding** [Boolean, optional]: The flag to enable [ip forwarding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-network-interface#enable-or-disable-ip-forwarding) for network interfaces of all VMs who have this VM type/extension. The ip forwarding can be enabled/disabled either in a VM type/extension (higher priority) or a network configuration (lower priority). If it's not specified in neither places, the default value is `false`. Available in v35.3.0+.
* **accelerated_networking** [Boolean, optional]: The flag to enable [accelerated networking](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli) for network interfaces of all VMs who have this VM type/extension. The accelerated networking can be enabled/disabled either in a VM type/extension (higher priority) or a network configuration (lower priority). If it's not specified in neither places, the default value is `false`. Available in v35.4.0+. This feature needs ubuntu-xenial v81+ and [specific instance type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/create-vm-accelerated-networking-cli#supported-vm-instances).

* **assign\_dynamic\_public\_ip** [Boolean, optional]: Enable to create and assign dynamic public IP to the VM automatically (to solve the [azure SNAT issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/issues/217)). Default value is `false`. Only the VM without vip will be assigned a dynamic public IP when this value is set to true, and the dynamic public IP will be deleted when the VM is deleted.

* **availability_zone** [String, optional]: Availability zone to use for creating instances (available in v33+). Possible values: `'1'`, `'2'`, `'3'`. Read this [document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview) to get regions and VM sizes on Azure that support availability zones. [More details about availability zone](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/tree/master/docs/advanced/availability-zone).
* **availability_set** [String, optional]: Name of an [availability set](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-manage-availability/) to use for VMs. [More details](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/tree/master/docs/advanced/deploy-cloudfoundry-for-enterprise#availability-set).
    * If available set does not exist, it will be automatically created.
    * If `availability_set` is not specified, Azure CPI will search `env.bosh.group` as the name of availability set.
        1. [bosh release](https://bosh.io/releases/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh?all=1) v258+ will generate a value for `env.bosh.group` automatically.
        1. On Azure the length of the availability set name must be between 1 and 80 characters. The name got from  `env.bosh.group` may be too long. CPI will truncate the name to the following format `az-MD5-[LAST-40-CHARACTERS-OF-GROUP]` if the length is greater than 80.
    * CPI v27+ will delete the empty availability set.
    * Only one of `availability_zone` and `availability_set` is allowed to be configured for a VM. If `availability_zone` is specified, the VM will be in a zone and not in any availability set.
* **platform\_update\_domain_count** [Integer, optional]: The count of [update domain](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-manage-availability/) in the availability set.
    * For Azure, the default value is `5`.
    * For Azure Stack, the default value is `1`.
* **platform\_fault\_domain_count** [Integer, optional]: The count of [fault domain](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-manage-availability/) in the availability set.
    * For Azure, the default value of an unmanaged availability set is `3`. The default value of a managed availability set is `2`, because [some regions don't support 3 fault domains for now](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-manage-availability#configure-multiple-virtual-machines-in-an-availability-set-for-redundancy)
    * For Azure Stack, the default value is `1`. Before 1802 update, only `1` is allowed. After [1802 update](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-update-1802), you can configure up to 3 fault domains.

* **storage\_account\_name** [String, optional]: Storage account for VMs. Valid only when `use_managed_disks` is `false`. If this is not set, the VMs will be created in the default storage account. See [this document](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-azure-cpi-release/tree/master/docs/advanced/deploy-cloudfoundry-for-enterprise#multiple-storage-accounts) for more details on why this option exists.
    * If you use `DS-series` or `GS-series` as `instance_type`, you should set this to a premium storage account. See more information about [Azure premium storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-premium-storage-preview-portal/). See [avaliable regions](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/#services) where you can create premium storage accounts.
    * If you use a different storage account which must be in the same resource group, please make sure:
        1. The permissions for the container `stemcell` in the default storage account is set to `Public read access for blobs only`.
        1. A table `stemcells` is created in the default storage account.
        1. Two containers `bosh` and `stemcell` are created in the new storage account.
    * If this storage account does not exist, it can be created automatically by Azure CPI. But you must specify storage\_account\_type and make sure:
        1. The name must be **unique within Azure**.
        1. **The name must be between 3 and 24 characters in length and use numbers and lower-case letters only**.
    * If you use a pattern `*keyword*`. CPI will filter all storage accounts under the default resource group by the pattern and pick one available storage account to create the VM.
        1. The pattern must start with `*` and end with `*`.
        1. The keyword must only contain numbers and lower-case letters because of the naming rule of storage account name.
        1. The rule to select an available storage account is to check the number of disks under the container `bosh` does not exceed the limitation.
        1. The default number of disks limitation is 30 but you can specify it in **storage\_account\_max\_disk\_number**.
* **storage\_account\_type** [String, optional]: Storage account type. You can click [**HERE**](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/) to learn more about the type of Azure storage account.
    * When `use_managed_disks` is `true`, the root disk's type is specified by this property. It can be either `Standard_LRS` or `Premium_LRS`. If not specified, `Premium_LRS` will be used when its `instance_type` supports premium storage, otherwise, `Standard_LRS` will be used.
    * When `use_managed_disks` is `false`, the newly-created storage account's type is specified by this property. It can be either `Standard_LRS`, `Standard_ZRS`, `Standard_GRS`, `Standard_RAGRS` or `Premium_LRS`. It's required if the storage account does not exist.
* **storage\_account\_max\_disk\_number** [Integer, optional]: Number of disks limitation in a storage account. Valid only when `use_managed_disks` is `false`. Default value is 30. This will be used only when **storage\_account\_name** is a pattern.
    * Every storage account has a limitation to host disks. You may hit the performance issue if you create too many disks in one storage account.
    * The maximum number of disks of a standard storage account is 40 because the maximum IOPS of a standard storage account is 20,000 and the maximum IOPS of a standard disk is 500.
    * If you are using premium storage account, Azure maps the disk size (rounded up) to the nearest Premium Storage Disk option (P10, P20 and P30). For example, a disk of size 100 GiB is classified as a P10 option.
        1. The maximum number of disks of a premium storage account is 280 if you are using P10 (128 GiB) as your disk type.
        1. The maximum number of disks of a premium storage account is 70 if you are using P20 (512 GiB) as your disk type.
        1. The maximum number of disks of a premium storage account is 35 if you are using P30 (1024 GiB) as your disk type.
    * **storage\_account\_max\_disk\_number** should be less than the maximum number. Suggest you to use (MAX - 10) as the value because CPI always creates VMs in parallel.
    * Please see more information about [azure-subscription-service-limits](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/azure-subscription-service-limits/).
* **storage\_account\_location** [String, optional]: Location of the storage account. This configuration is deprecated in CPI v25+: if you specify a storage account which does not exist, CPI (v25+) will create it automatically in the same location as VMs' VNET.

* **resource\_group\_name** [String, optional]: Name of a resource group (Available in v26+). If it is set, related resources will be created in this resource group; otherwise, they will be created in `resource_group_name` specified in the global CPI settings. The resources affected by this property are:
      1. Virtual Machine
      1. Network Interface Card
      1. Managed Disks (including OS disk, ephemeral disk, persistent disk and snapshot)
      1. Dynamic Public IP for the VM
      1. Availability Set

* **tags** [Hash, optional]: Custom tags of VMs (Available in v35.4.0+). They are name-value pairs that are used to organize VMs.
    * Before configuring it, please review [the limitations apply to tags](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-using-tags).
    * In Azure, each VM can have a maximum of 15 tag name-value pairs. Currently, BOSH director and Azure CPI use at most 10 tags. So it is not recommended to use more than 3 custom tags.

Example of a `Standard_A2` VM:

```yaml
vm_types:
- name: default
  cloud_properties:
    instance_type: Standard_A2
    root_disk:
      size: 30_720
    ephemeral_disk:
      use_root_disk: false
      size: 30_720
```

Example of a load balancer:

```yaml
vm_extensions:
- name: load-balancer
  cloud_properties:
    load_balancer: <load-balancer-name>
```

Example of an availability set:

```yaml
vm_extensions:
- name: availability-set
  cloud_properties:
    availability_set: <availability-set-name>
```

The above load-balancer cloud configuration examples are referenced within the deployment manifest as such:

```yaml
instance_groups:
- name: router
  instances: 2
  azs: [z1, z2]
  networks: [{name: default}]
  vm_type: default
  stemcell: default
  jobs:
  - name: router
    release: default
  vm_extensions: [load-balancer]
```

Please always use `N * 1024` as the size because Azure always uses GiB not MiB.

```yaml
disk_types:
- name: default
  disk_size: 10_240
```

---
## Global Configuration {: #global }

Schema:

* **environment** [String, required]: Azure environment name. Possible values are: `AzureCloud`, `AzureChinaCloud`, `AzureUSGovernment` (available in v19+), `AzureGermanCloud` (available in v22+) or `AzureStack`.

You can use the default value for [Azure Stack development kit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-stack/development-kit/). To get this value for Azure Stack integrated systems, contact your service provider.
    * **authentication** [String, optional]: The authentication type for your AzureStack deployment. Possible values are: `AzureAD`, `AzureChinaCloudAD` and `ADFS`. You need to specify `certificate` if you select `ADFS`, because Azure Stack with ADFS authentication only supports the service principal with a certificate.
    * **resource** [String, optional]: Active Directory Service Endpoint Resource ID, where you can get the token for your AzureStack deployment.
    * **endpoint_prefix** [String, optional]: The endpoint prefix for your AzureStack deployment. Default is `management`.

        * The property is required for v35.0.0+.
        * For the versions from v27 to v34, if `ca_cert` is not provided, the `skip_ssl_validation` and `use_http_to_access_storage_account` must be set to `true`.
* **parallel\_upload\_thread\_num** [Integer, optional]: The number of threads to upload stemcells in parallel. The default value is 16.
* **debug_mode** [Boolean, optional]: Enable debug mode. The default value is `false`. When `debug_mode` is `true`:
    * CPI will log all raw HTTP requests/responses.
    * For Azure CPI v26~v35.1.0, the new created VMs (only for VMs in same region with `storage_account_name` specified in [Global Configuration](https://bosh.io/docs/azure-cpi.html#global)) will have [boot diagnostics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/boot-diagnostics-for-virtual-machines-v2/) enabled. **Note**: For Azure CPI v35.2.0+, VM boot diagnostics will NOT be configured by `debug_mode` any more, it will be configured by `enable_vm_boot_diagnostics`.
* **use\_managed\_disks** [Boolean, optional]: Enable managed disks. The default value is `false`. For `AzureCloud`, the option is supported in v21+. For `AzureChinaCloud`, `AzureUSGovernment`, and `AzureGermanCloud`, the option is supported in v26+. For `AzureStack`, the option is not yet supported.

* **keep\_failed\_vms** [Boolean, optional]: A flag to keep the failed VM. If it's set to `true` and CPI fails to **provision** the VM, CPI will keep the VM for troubleshooting. The default value is `false`. Available in v32+. Please note that the option is different from **keep\_unreachable\_vms** of the [director configuration](https://bosh.io/jobs/director?source=github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh). The latter is to keep the VM whose BOSH agent is unresponsive.
* **enable_telemetry** [Boolean, optional]: A flag to enable telemetry on CPI calls on Azure. Available since v35.2.0. The default value is `true` in v35.2.0, and is `false` in v35.3.0+.
* **enable\_vm\_boot\_diagnostics** [Boolean, optional]: A flag to enable VM boot diagnostics on Azure. Available since v35.2.0. The default value is `true` in v35.2.0, and is `false` in v35.3.0+.
