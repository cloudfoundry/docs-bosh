![Cloud Foundry BOSH](images/logo-full.png)

BOSH is a project that unifies release engineering, deployment, and lifecycle management of small and large-scale cloud software. BOSH can provision and deploy software over hundreds of VMs. It also performs monitoring, failure recovery, and software updates with zero-to-minimal downtime.

While BOSH was developed to deploy Cloud Foundry PaaS, it can also be used to deploy almost any other software (Hadoop, for instance). BOSH is particularly well-suited for large distributed systems. In addition, BOSH supports multiple Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers like VMware vSphere, Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services EC2, Microsoft Azure, and OpenStack. There is a Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) that enables users to extend BOSH to support additional IaaS providers such as Apache CloudStack and VirtualBox.


## Getting Started

### CLI

The [`bosh` CLI](cli-v2.md) is the command line tool used for interacting with all things BOSH. Release binaries are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-cli/releases). See [Installation](cli-v2-install.md) for more details on how to download and install.
