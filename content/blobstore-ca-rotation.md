    Linux stemcells v3586.5+ (agent 2.83.0)

# Rotating the Blobstore CA

As of director version 266.2.0+, TLS is enabled for the default DAV blobstore.

Due to limitations in stemcell support, the agent does not contact the blobstore over TLS by default. Refer to additional opsfiles in [bosh-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment) to enable full end-to-end TLS.

## Ignored Instances

Please take note of any ignored instances with `bosh instances --details`. These instances will not be considered when redeploying or recreating instances. Ignored instances will only receive the new certificates when recreated.

## Introducing a New Certificate Authority (CA) 

This procedure works by deploying both the old and the new CA on all the VMs in a transitional fashion. The old CA is purged eventually. To achieve this, the procedure requires multiple deploys and recreates of all the deployments.  Note that this method is analogous to the one used for [NATS CA rotation](nats-ca-rotation.md), which could be performed at the same time as this one.

### Preconditions

* The Director is in a healthy state.
* All the VMs are in the `running` state in all deployments.
* These instructions must be adapted if used with bosh-lite ops files, as they overwrite the variables used in this procedure.


### Step 1: Redeploy the director with the new blobstore CA. {: #step-1}

```shell
bosh create-env ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/bosh.yml \
 --state ./state.json \
 -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/[IAAS]/cpi.yml \
 -o add-new-blobstore-ca.yml \
 -o ... additional opsfiles \
 --vars-store ./creds.yml \
 -v ... additional vars
```

* This adds new variables for the new CA/certificates/private_key.
* The director is given a modified CA with the original CA and the new CA concatenated as `((blobstore_server_tls.ca))((blobstore_server_tls_2.ca))`.
* The blobstore continues to use the old certificates and private key.
* Each VM/agent continues to use the old certificates to communicate with the blobstore.

`add-new-blobstore-ca.yml`

```yaml
---
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/properties/agent/env/bosh/blobstores?/provider=dav/options/tls/cert/ca
  value: ((blobstore_server_tls_2.ca))((blobstore_server_tls.ca))

- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/properties/blobstore/tls?/cert/ca
  value: ((blobstore_server_tls_2.ca))((blobstore_server_tls.ca))
 
- type: replace
  path: /variables/-
  value:
    name: blobstore_ca_2
    type: certificate
    options:
      is_ca: true
      common_name: default.blobstore-ca.bosh-internal

- type: replace
  path: /variables/-
  value:
    name: blobstore_server_tls_2
    type: certificate
    options:
      ca: blobstore_ca_2
      common_name: ((internal_ip))
      alternative_names: [((internal_ip))]
```

### Step 2: Recreate all the VMs, for each deployment. {: #step-2}

The VMs need to be recreated in order to receive the new certificates generated from the new Blobstore CA being rotated in. If the VMs are not recreated, the agents they contain will not be able to communicate with the blobstore since they will not trust the new CA used to sign the blobstore's certificate. 

```shell
bosh -d deployment-name recreate
```

### Step 3: Redeploy the director to remove the old Blobstore CA. {: #step-3}

```shell
bosh create-env ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/bosh.yml \
 --state ./state.json \
 -o ~/workspace/bosh-deployment/[IAAS]/cpi.yml \
 -o remove-old-blobstore-ca.yml \
 -o ... additional opsfiles \
 --vars-store ./creds.yml \
 -v ... additional vars
```

`remove-old-blobstore-ca.yml`

* `remove-old-blobstore-ca` below is used to remove the old CA from the concatenated CAs.
* The blobstore server is updated to use a new certificate and private key, generated by the new CA.
* All the components can now communicate using the new CA.

```yaml
---
- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/properties/agent/env/bosh/blobstores?/provider=dav/options/tls/cert/ca
  value: ((blobstore_server_tls_2.ca))

- type: replace
  path: /instance_groups/name=bosh/properties/blobstore/tls?/cert
  value:
    ca: ((blobstore_server_tls_2.ca))
    certificate: ((blobstore_server_tls_2.certificate))
    private_key: ((blobstore_server_tls_2.private_key))

- type: replace
  path: /variables/-
  value:
    name: blobstore_ca_2
    type: certificate
    options:
      is_ca: true
      common_name: default.blobstore-ca.bosh-internal

- type: replace
  path: /variables/-
  value:
    name: blobstore_server_tls_2
    type: certificate
    options:
      ca: blobstore_ca_2
      common_name: ((internal_ip))
      alternative_names: [((internal_ip))]
```

### Step 4: Recreate all VMs, for each deployment. {: #step-4}

Recreating all the VMs will remove the old CA from them. The usual way to do this is:

```shell
bosh -d deployment-name recreate
```

Other BOSH commands can be used to recreate the VMs, while others will restart the VMs without recreating them. Please take note of the remarks below. 


#### Commands that will reset the blobstore configuration on the deployed VMs
  - stop hard and start VMs
```
bosh -d deployment-name stop --hard
bosh -d deployment-name start
```
  - recreate VMs
```
bosh -d deployment-name recreate
```

#### Commands that will NOT reset the blobstore configuration on the deployed VM
  - restart VMs
```
bosh -d deployment-name restart
```
  - just stop and start VMs
```
bosh -d deployment-name stop
bosh -d deployment-name start
```


## Troubleshooting

Any instances that have not been recreated with `bosh recreate` or through a redeploy causing a recreate will fail with errors like the one below. Perform a `bosh recreate --fix` on any instances impacting a redeploy.
