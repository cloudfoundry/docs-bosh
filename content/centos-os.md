# Stemcell OS: CentOS

The base CentOS operating system is built from the [cloudfoundry/bosh-linux-stemcell-builder](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-linux-stemcell-builder) repository.

The most recent version is built every two weeks to ensure the latest upstream patches are included. These builds are published on [bosh.io/stemcells](https://bosh.io/stemcells) as new, minor versions.

!!! tip
    [Ubuntu Xenial](ubuntu-os.md#ubuntu-xenial) is the recommended Linux distribution for deploying with BOSH.
