## Feature Support

The following sections describe some specific BOSH features supported by the CPI.


### Network

The CPI supports multiple NICs being attached to a single VM.

| Network Type | Support |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Manual | Multiple networks per instance |
| Dynamic | Not Supported |
| VIP | Not Supported |


### Encryption

vSphere supports disk encryption and customer-managed keys when managed through policy configuration within the vCenter 6.5+ ([learn more](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-A29066CD-8EF8-4A4E-9FC9-8628E05FC859.html)). For this functionality, encryption occurs at the hypervisor level which is transparent to the VM. Once enabled within vCenter, no additional configuration is required for the CPI.

| Disk Type | Encryption |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Root Disk | Supported |
| Ephemeral Disk | Supported |
| Persistent Disk | Supported |


### Miscellaneous

| Feature | Support |
| ------- | ------- |
| Multi-CPI | Supported, [v34](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-vsphere-cpi-release/releases/tag/v34)+ |
| Native Disk Resize | Not Supported |
