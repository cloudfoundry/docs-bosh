## Metrics Server

!!! note
    This feature is available with BOSH release v270.10.0+. It is an ongoing feature and new functionality will continue to be exposed in later releases.

As of `v270.10.0` the director can now be deployed with a co-located metrics
server which will report Prometheus style metrics about the director and it's
deployed VMs.

The metrics server can be enabled by setting the
`properties.director.metrics_server.enabled` property to true. If you are using
[bosh-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment), the
[`experimental/enable-metrics.yml`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-deployment/blob/master/experimental/enable-metrics.yml)
operations file will enable the metrics server.

Currently the metrics server is secured using mutual auth TLS. In order to
successfully enable the metrics server, you will need to specify the following
variables:

* `properties.director.metrics_server.tls.ca`
* `properties.director.metrics_server.tls.certificate`
* `properties.director.metrics_server.tls.private_key`

Similarly when connecting to the metrics server from a client, such as a
Prometheus metrics collector, you will need to specify valid client certificate
credentials.

By default the metrics server will listen on port 9091, but this can be
configured through the `properties.director.metrics_server.port` settings.

The metrics server serves two endpoints, `/metrics` and `/api_metrics`.
Currently it exposes the following metrics:

* `bosh_resurrection_enabled`: Status of resurrection. 0 for disabled, 1 for
  enabled.
* `bosh_tasks_total`: Number of BOSH active tasks, labeled with their current state (either 'processing' or 'queued') and type.
* `bosh_networks_dynamic_ips_total`: Size of network pool for all dynamically
  allocated IP addresses.
* `bosh_networks_dynamic_free_ips_total`: Number of free dynamic IP addresses
  left per network.
* `bosh_unresponsive_agents`: Number of unresponsive agents per deployment
* Generic API metrics for the director's endpoints including number of requests
  and response time.

### BOSH Director VM Metrics

At the moment the built in director monitoring only provides information about
the director's API and resources that it manages. In order to expose metrics
about the director's VM, we recommend that you co-locate an agent that performs
this functionality.
