title: What Problems Does BOSH Solve?
---

BOSH allows developers to version, package, and deploy software in a reproducible manner. While many tools exist to solve the individual parts of versioning, packaging, and deploying software reproducibly, BOSH is designed to do each of these as a whole.

The [Release Engineering page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_engineering) n Wikipedia identifies four principles of the modern release engineering process. BOSH addresses each of them in the following ways:

> **Identifiability** Being able to identify all of the source, tools, environment, and other components that make up a particular release.

The BOSH concept of software release packages all related source code, binary assets, configuration etc. This allows users to track content in a particular release. In addition to releases, BOSH provides a way to capture all Operating System dependencies as one image.

> **Reproducibility** The ability to integrate source, third party components, data, and deployment externals of a software system in order to guarantee operational stability.

The BOSH tool chain provides a centralized server that manages software releases, Operating System images, persistent data, and system configuration. It also provides a clear and simple way of operating deployed systems.

> **Consistency** The mission to provide a stable framework for development, deployment, audit, and accountability for software components.

BThe BOSH software release workflows are used throughout the development of the software and when the system needs to be deployed. The BOSH centralized server allows users to see and track changes made to the deployed system.

> **Agility** The ongoing research into what are the repercussions of modern software engineering practices on the productivity in the software cycle, i.e. continuous integration.

The BOSH tool chain integrates well with the current best practices of software engineering (including Continuous Delivery) by providing ways to create software releases in an automated way and to update complex deployed systems with simple commands.
