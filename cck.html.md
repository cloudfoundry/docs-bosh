title: Manual repair with Cloud Check
---

<p class="note">Note: Updated for bosh-release v183 (1.3010.0).</p>

BOSH provides the Cloud Check CLI command (a.k.a cck) to repair IaaS resources used by a specific deployment. It is not commonly used during normal operations; however, it becomes essential when some IaaS operations fail and the Director cannot resolve problems without a human decision or when the Resurrector is not enabled.

The Resurrector will only try to recover any VMs that are missing from the IaaS or that have non-responsive agents. The cck tool is similar to the Resurrector in that it also looks for those two conditions; however, instead of automatically trying to resolve these problems, it provides several options to the operator.

In addition to looking for those two types of problems, cck also checks correct attachment and presence of persistent disks for each deployment job instance.

Once the deployment is set via the `bosh deployment` command you can simply run `bosh cck`. Here is an example output when no problems are detected:

<pre class="terminal wide">
$ bosh cck

Assuming there was a deployment with a VM, somehow that VM was deleted from the IaaS outside of BOSH, here is what cck would report:

</pre>

cck determined that `i-914c046a` VM was missing. Possible options are:

1. `Skip for now`: the Director will not try to resolve this problem right now

2. `Recreate VM`: the Director will just create new VM, deploy specified releases according to deployed manifest and finally start release jobs

    Note on current behaviour: cck will not wait for all release job processes to start.

3. `Delete VM reference`: the Director will not create new VM in its place. If cck is run again, it will not report that VM is missing since it's not expected to exist. Running `bosh deploy` after cck will backfill missing VMs.

In the above example options 3 was picked and VM reference was deleted.

### <a id="not-responsive-vm"></a> VM is not responsive (unresponsive agent)

Assuming there was a deployment with a VM, somehow Agent is no longer responding to the Director. In this situation `bosh vms` will report VM's agent as `unresponsive agent`:

<pre class="terminal wide">
$ bosh vms simple-deployment --details

Deployment `simple-deployment'

Also `bosh deploy` will stop at `Binding existing deployment` stage since it is not able to communicate with unresponsive agent:

cck determined that `i-914c046a` VM is unresponsive. Possible options are:

1. `Skip for now`: the Director will not try to resolve this problem right now

2. `Reboot VM`: the Director will power off and then power on existing VM

    Note on current behaviour: cck will not wait for all release job processes to start.

3. `Recreate VM`: the Director will delete existing VM, then create a new VM, deploy specified releases according to deployed manifest and finally start release jobs

    Note on current behaviour: cck will not wait for all release job processes to start.

4. `Delete VM reference`: the Director will not create new VM in its place. If cck is run again, it will not report that VM is unresponsive since it does not exist. Running `bosh deploy` after cck will backfill missing VMs.

In the above example options 4 was picked and VM reference was deleted.

cck determined that `vol-549f071f` persistent disk is not attached to `i-4fcd99b4` VM. Possible options are:

1. `Skip for now`: the Director will not try to resolve this problem during

2. `Reattach disk to instance`: the Director will reattach persistent disk to the VM and mount it at its usual location `/var/vcap/store`.

    Note on current behaviour: Release job processes will not be restarted when persistent disk is remounted.

3. `Reattach disk and reboot instance`: the Director will reattach persistent disk to the VM and reboot it so that Agent can safely mount persistent disk before starting any release job processes.

    Note on current behaviour: cck will not wait until VM reboots and restarts all release job processes.

### <a id="missing-persistent-disk"></a> Persistent Disk is missing

Assuming there was a deployment with a VM, somehow persistent disk got deleted.

Note: Not all CPIs implement needed functionality to determine if disk is missing. Those CPIs will report missing disk as [Persistent Disk is not attached](#unattached-persistent-disk) problem; however, both reattaching resolutions will fail since persistent disk would not be found.
