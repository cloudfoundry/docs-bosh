title: BOSH Components

This topic describes the components of BOSH and provides an example component interaction.

## <a id="list"></a>List of BOSH Components ##

### <a id="agent"></a>Agent ###
BOSH creates an Agent on every VM that BOSH deploys.
A BOSH Agent listens for instructions from the BOSH Director to the VM and
carries out those instructions.
The Agent receives job specifications from the Director and uses them to assign
a role, or Job, to the VM.

For example, to assign the Job of running MySQL to a VM, the Director sends
instructions to the Agent on the VM.
These instructions include which packages to install and how to configure those
packages.
The Agent uses these instructions to install and configure MySQL on the VM.

### <a id="blobstore"></a>Blobstore ###
The BOSH Blobstore stores the source forms of releases and packages and the
compiled images of BOSH packages.
An operator uploads a release using the BOSH CLI, and the Director inserts the
release into the Blobstore.
When you deploy a release, BOSH orchestrates the compilation of packages and
stores the result in the Blobstore.

### <a id="cli"></a>BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI) ###
The BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI) is the primary operator interface to BOSH.
An operator uses the CLI to interact with the BOSH Director and perform actions
on the cloud.

### <a id="database"></a>BOSH Database ###
The BOSH Director uses a Postgres database to store information about the
desired state of a BOSH deployment.
This includes information about releases, packages, stemcells, and deployments.

### <a id="name-server"></a>BOSH DNS Name Server ###
BOSH uses PowerDNS to provide DNS resolution between the VMs in a BOSH
deployment.

### <a id="cpi"></a>Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) ###
A Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) is an API that BOSH uses to interact with an
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider to create and manage stemcells and
VMs.
A CPI abstracts the cloud infrastructure from the rest of BOSH.

### <a id="director"></a>Director ###
The BOSH Director is the core orchestrating component in BOSH.
The Director controls VM creation and deployment, as well as other software and
service lifecycle events.

The Director creates actionable tasks:

* by translating commands sent by an operator through the BOSH CLI
* from scheduled processes like backups or snapshots
* if needed to reconcile the expected state with the actual state of a VM

Once created, the Director adds these tasks to the Task Queue.
BOSH Worker processes take tasks from the Task Queue and act on them.

### <a id="health-monitor"></a>Health Monitor ###
The Health Monitor uses status and lifecycle events received from BOSH Agents to
monitor the health of VMs.
If the Health Monitor detects a problem with a VM, it can send an alert through
a notification plugin, or trigger the BOSH Resurrector.

### <a id="nats"></a>Message Bus (NATS) ###
The Director and the Agents communicate through a lightweight publish-subscribe
and distributed queueing messaging system called NATS.
These messages have two purposes: to confirm the health of the Agent, and to
inform the Director about changes in the health of monitored processes.

### <a id="registry"></a>Registry ###
When BOSH creates or updates a VM, BOSH stores the following VM configuration
information in the registry:

* IP addresses for the network interface, gateway, and netmask
* IDs for the volume reserved for the VM, for the VM itself, and for disks and other devices

### <a id="resurrector"></a>Resurrector ###
If enabled, the BOSH Resurrector plugin automatically recreates VMs identified
by the Health Monitor as stopped or unresponsive.

### <a id="queue"></a>Task Queue ###
An asynchronous queue used by the BOSH Director and Workers to manage tasks.
The Task Queue resides in a Redis key-value store.

### <a id="workers"></a>Workers ###
BOSH Workers take tasks from the Task Queue and act on them.

## <a id="example"></a>Example Component Interaction ##
This example shows how BOSH components interact when creating a new VM.

### <a id="create-vm"></a>Creating a New VM ###
<%= image_tag("/images/deploy-sequence.png") %><br />

1. Through the BOSH CLI, the operator takes an action (e.g. deploy for the first
time, scaling up deployment) which requires creating a new VM.
1. The CLI passes the instruction to the Director.
1. The Director uses the CPI to tell the IaaS to launch a VM.
1. The IaaS provides the Director with IP address and ID information the
Agent on the VM needs to configure the VM.
1. The Director updates the BOSH Registry with the configuration information for
the VM.
1. The Agent running on the VM requests the configuration information for the VM
from the BOSH Registry.
1. The BOSH Registry responds with the IP addresses and IDs.
1. The Agent uses the IP addresses and IDs to configure the VM.

**Note**: vSphere does not use the BOSH Registry.
Instead, BOSH attaches a CD-ROM ISO image with the necessary information to each
vSphere VM.
