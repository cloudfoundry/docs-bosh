title: Upload Stemcells

<p class="note">Note: Document uses CLI v2.</p>

(See [What is a Stemcell?](stemcell.html) for an introduction to stemcells.)

As described earlier, each deployment can reference one or more stemcells. For a deploy to succeed, necessary stemcells must be uploaded to the Director.

## <a id='find'></a> Finding Stemcells

The [stemcells section of bosh.io](http://bosh.io/stemcells) lists official stemcells.

## <a id='upload'></a> Uploading to the Director

CLI provides [`bosh upload-stemcell` command](cli-v2.html#upload-stemcell).

- If you have a URL to a stemcell tarball (for example URL provided by bosh.io):

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh -e vbox upload-stemcell https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent?v=3468.5 --sha1 b95fac2b5d27a3c91b762b1df3747110b058a145
    </pre>

- If you have a stemcell tarball on your local machine:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh upload-stemcell ~/Downloads/bosh-stemcell-3468.5-warden-boshlite-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent.tgz
    </pre>

Once the command succeeds you can view all uploaded stemcells in the Director:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh -e vbox stemcells
Using environment '192.168.50.6' as client 'admin'

Name                                         Version  OS             CPI  CID
