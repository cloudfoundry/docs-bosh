title: Manifest v2 Schema
---

<p class="note">Note: This feature is available with bosh-release v255.4+.</p>

<p class="note">Note: Once you opt into using cloud config all deployments must be converted to use manifest v2 format that disallows IaaS specific configuration.</p>

The deployment manifest is a YAML file that defines the components and properties of the deployment. When an operator initiates a new deployment using the CLI, the Director receives a manifest and creates or updates a deployment with matching name.

Assuming that you are using [cloud config](cloud-config.html), your deployment manifest is expected to have:

* [Deployment Identification](#deployment): A name for the deployment and the UUID of the Director managing the deployment
* [Releases Block](#releases): Name and version of each release in a deployment
* [Stemcells Block](#stemcells): Name and version of each stemcell in a deployment
* [Update Block](#update): Defines how BOSH updates instances during deployment
* [Instance Groups Block](#instance-groups): Configuration and resource information for instance groups
* [Properties Block](#properties): Describes global properties and generalized configuration information

---
## <a id='deployment'></a> Deployment Identification

**name** [String, required]: The name of the deployment. A single Director can manage multiple deployments and distinguishes them by name.

**director_uuid** [String, required]: This string must match the UUID of the currently targeted Director for the CLI to allow any operations on the deployment. Use `bosh status` to display the UUID of the currently targeted Director.

Example:

```yaml
name: my-redis
director_uuid: cf8dc1fc-9c42-4ffc-96f1-fbad983a6ce6
```

---
## <a id='releases'></a> Releases Block

**releases** [Array, required]: The name and version of each release in the deployment.

* **name** [String, required]: Name of a release used in the deployment.
* **version** [String, required]: The version of the release to use. Version can be `latest`.

Example:

```yaml
releases:
- {name: redis, version: 12}
```

---
## <a id='stemcells'></a> Stemcells Block

**stemcells** [Array, required]: The name and version of each stemcell in the deployment.

* **alias** [String, required]: Name of a stemcell used in the deployment
* **os** [String, optional]: Operating system of a matching stemcell. Example: `ubuntu-trusty`.
* **version** [String, required]: The version of a matching stemcell. Version can be `latest`.
* **name** [String, optional]: Full name of a matching stemcell. Either `name` or `os` keys can be specified.

Example:

```yaml
stemcells:
- alias: default
  os: ubuntu-trusty
  version: 3147
- alias: default2
  name: bosh-aws-xen-hvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent
  version: 3149
```

---
## <a id='update'></a> Update Block

**update** [Hash, required]: This specifies instance update properties. These properties control how BOSH updates instances during the deployment.

* **canaries** [Integer, required]: The number of [canary](./terminology.html#canary) instances.
* **max\_in\_flight** [Integer, required]: The maximum number of non-canary instances to update in parallel.
* **canary\_watch\_time** [Integer or Range, required]
    * If the `canary_watch_time` is an integer, the Director sleeps for that many milliseconds, then checks whether the canary instances are healthy.
    * If the `canary_watch_time` is a range (low-high), the Director:
        * Waits for `low` milliseconds
        * Waits until instances are healthy or `high` milliseconds have passed since instances started updating
* **update\_watch\_time** [Integer or Range, required]
    * If the `update_watch_time` is an integer, the Director sleeps for that many milliseconds, then checks whether the instances are healthy.
    * If the `update_watch_time` is a range (low-high), the Director:
        * Waits for `low` milliseconds
        * Waits until instances are healthy or `high` milliseconds have passed since instances started updating
* **serial** [Boolean, optional]: If disabled (set to `false`), instance groups will be deployed in parallel, otherwise - sequentially. Instances within a group will still follow `canary` and `max_in_flight` configuration. Defaults to `true`.

Example:

```yaml
update:
  canaries: 1
  max_in_flight: 10
  canary_watch_time: 1000-30000
  update_watch_time: 1000-30000
```

## <a id='instance-groups'></a> Instance Groups Block

**instance_groups** [Array, required]: Specifies the mapping between release [jobs](./terminology.html#job) and instance groups.

* **name** [String, required]: A unique name used to identify and reference instance group.
* **azs** [Array, required]: List of AZs associated with this instance group (should only be used when using [first class AZs](azs.html)). Example: `[z1, z2]`.
* **instances** [Integer, required]: The number of instances in this group. Each instance is a VM.
* **jobs** [Array, required]: Specifies the name and release of jobs that will be installed on each instance.
  * **name** [String, required]: The job name
  * **release** [String, required]: The release where the job exists
  * **consumes** [Hash, optional]: Links consumes by the job. [Read more about link configuration](links.html#deployment)
  * **provides** [Hash, optional]: Links provided by the job. [Read more about link configuration](links.html#deployment)
  * **properties** [Hash, required]: Specifies job properties. Properties allow BOSH to configure jobs to a specific environment. `properties` defined in a Job block are accessible only to that job. Only properties specified here will be provided to the job.
* **vm_type** [String, required]: A valid VM type name from the cloud config.
* **vm_extensions** [Array, required]: A valid list of VM extension names from the cloud config.
* **stemcell** [String, required]: A valid stemcell alias from the Stemcells Block.
* **persistent\_disk\_type** [String, optional]: A valid disk type name from the cloud config. [Read more about persistent disks](./persistent-disks.html)
* **networks** [Array, required]: Specifies the networks this instance requires. Each network can have the following properties specified:
  * **name** [String, required]: A valid network name from the cloud config.
  * **static_ips** [Array, optional]: Array of IP addresses reserved for the instances on the network.
  * **default** [Array, optional]: Specifies which network components (DNS, Gateway) BOSH populates by default from this network. This property is required if more than one network is specified.
* **update** [Hash, optional]: Specific update settings for this instance group. Use this to override [global job update settings](#update) on a per-instance-group basis.
* **migrated_from** [Array, optional]: Specific migration settings for this instance group. Use this to [rename and/or migrate instance groups](migrated-from.html).
* **lifecycle** [String, optional]: Specifies the kind of workload the instance group represents. Valid values are `service` and `errand`; defaults to `service`. A `service` runs indefinitely and restarts if it fails. An `errand` starts with a manual trigger and does not restart if it fails.
* **properties** [Hash, optional]: Specifies instance group properties. Deprecated in favor of job level properties and links.

Example:

```yaml
instance_groups:
- name: redis-master
  instances: 1
  jobs:
  - name: redis-server
    release: redis
    properties:
      port: 3606
  vm_type: medium
  vm_extensions: [public-lbs]
  stemcell: default
  persistent_disk_type: medium
  networks:
  - name: default

- name: redis-slave
  instances: 2
  jobs:
  - name: redis-server
    release: redis
    properties: {}
  vm_type: medium
  stemcell: default
  persistent_disk_type: medium
  networks:
  - name: default

## <a id='properties'></a> Properties Block

**properties** [Hash, optional]: Describes global properties. Deprecated in favor of job level properties and links.
