title: Deploying Director into a vSphere Resource Pool
---

If the BOSH director is required to be deployed within a vSphere Resource Pool, utilize the following additional CLI arguments when creating the BOSH env:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh create-env bosh-deployment/bosh.yml \
    -o ... \
    -o bosh-deployment/vsphere/resource-pool.yml \
    -v ... \
    -v vcenter_rp=my-bosh-rp
</pre>

<p class="note">Note that the vSphere resource pool must already be created before running the `bosh create-env` command.</a>
