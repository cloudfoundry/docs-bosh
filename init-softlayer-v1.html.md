title: Initializing BOSH environment on SoftLayer
---

<p class="note">Note: See <a href="init-softlayer.html">Creating environment on SoftLayer</a> with CLI v2. (Recommended)</p>

This document shows how to initialize new [environment](terminology.html#environment) on SoftLayer.

## <a id="create-manifest"></a>Step 1: Create a Deployment Manifest

1. Create a deployment directory.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ mkdir ~/my-bosh
    </pre>

1. Create a deployment manifest file named `bosh.yml` in the deployment directory based on the template below.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The example below uses several predefined passwords. We recommend replacing them with passwords of your choice.</p>

<pre id="manifest">

We need to specify the director hostname ``bosh-softlayer.softlayer.com`` in ``mbus: "nats://nats:nats-password@bosh-softlayer.softlayer.com:4222‚Äù`` or ``mbus: https://admin:admin-password@bosh-softlayer.softlayer.com:6868``. This is Softlayer specific. Before the director is created, we don't know its IP. Softlayer CPI will change the hostname to IP after the director is created.

## <a id="prepare"></a> Step 2: Prepare a SoftLayer Environment

To prepare your SoftLayer environment:

* [Create a SoftLayer account](#account)
* [Generate an API Key](#api-key)
* [Access SoftLayer VPN](#vpn)
* [Order VLANs](#vlan)

---
### <a id="account"></a> Create a Softlayer account

If you do not have an SoftLayer account, [create one for one month free](https://www.softlayer.com/promo/freeCloud).

Use the login credentials received in your provided email to login to SoftLayer [Customer Portal](https://control.softlayer.com).

---
### <a id="api-key"></a> Generate an API Key

API keys are used to securely access the SoftLayer API. Follow [Generate an API Key](http://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/procedure/generate-api-key) to generate your API key.

---
### <a id="vpn"></a> Access SoftLayer VPN

To access SoftLayer Private network, you need to access SoftLayer VPN. Follow [VPN Access](http://www.softlayer.com/vpn-access) to access the VPN. You can get your VPN password from your [user profile](https://control.softlayer.com/account/user/profile). Follow [VPN Access](http://www.softlayer.com/vpn-access) to access the VPN.

---
### <a id="vlan"></a> Order VLANs

VLANs provide the ability to partition devices and subnets on the network. To order VLANs, login to SoftLayer [Customer Portal](https://control.softlayer.com) and navigate to Network > IP Management > VLANs. Once on the page, click the "Order VLAN" link in the top-right corner. Fill in the pop-up window to order the VLANs as you need. The VLAN IDs are needed in the deployment manifest.

---

## <a id="deploy"></a> Step 3: Deploy

<p class="note">Note: See <a href="migrate-to-bosh-init.html">Migrating to bosh-init from the micro CLI plugin</a> if you have an existing MicroBOSH.</p>

1. Install [bosh-init](./install-bosh-init.html).

1. Establish VPN connection between your host and Softlayer. The machine where to run bosh-init needs to communicate with the target director VM over the SoftLayer private network.

1. Run `bosh-init deploy ./bosh.yml` with sudo to start the deployment process. The reason why need to run `bosh-init deploy` with sudo is that it needs to update `/etc/hosts` file which needs suffient permission. 

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ sudo bosh-init deploy ./bosh.yml
    ...
    </pre>

1. Install the [BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI)](./bosh-cli.html).

1. Use `bosh target DIRECTOR-IP` to log into your new BOSH Director. You can get the DIRECTOR-IP from /etc/hosts on boshcli vm. The default username and password are `admin` and `admin` if no user is configured in manifest in advance when deploying director or created by `bosh create user` command.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh target DIRECTOR-IP

    Target set to 'bosh'
    Your username: admin
    Enter password: *****
    Logged in as 'admin'

    $ bosh vms

    No deployments
    </pre>

1. Save the deployment state file left in your deployment directory so you can later update/delete your Director. See [Deployment state](using-bosh-init.html#deployment-state) section of 'Using bosh-init' for more details.
