title: Agent-CPI Interactions
---

Here is an overview of the interactions between the CPI and the Agent on CloudStack as an example:

* The CPI drives the IaaS and the Agent.
* The Agent is a versatile process which configures the OS to leverage IaaS-provisionned resources (network interfaces, disks, etc.), and perform other BOSH tasks (jobs compilation, jobs instantiation, etc.)
* The CPI asks the IaaS to instanciate VM template, VMs, volumes and possibly other constructs (floating IPs, security groups, connect LBs, etc.)
* The Agent is initially driven by the CPI through the bosh-registry, and then by the Director through NATS-based messaging. The registry provides Director-side meta data to the Agent.

## <a id="agent-config"></a> Agent config file formats

This section details the configuration and protocols supported by the Agent.

The [VM Configuration Locations](vm-config.html#agent) provides a list of the configuration files that the Agent and their roles.

----
### <a id="agent-json"></a> `agent.json` file

`/var/vcap/bosh/agent.json`: Start up settings for the Agent that describe how to find bootstrap settings, and disable certain Agent functionality.

The loading agent.json file is described into [config_test.go](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent/blob/master/app/config_test.go)

The Platform part of the file is documented into [LinuxOptions](https://godoc.org/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent/platform#LinuxOptions)

The Infrastructure part of the file is documented into [Options](https://godoc.org/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent/infrastructure#Options) and in particular:

 * the sources of configuration with [SettingsOptions](https://godoc.org/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent/infrastructure#SettingsOptions):

    * [CDROM](https://godoc.org/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent/infrastructure#CDROMSourceOptions)
    * [ConfigDrive](https://godoc.org/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent/infrastructure#ConfigDriveSourceOptions)
    * [HTTP](https://godoc.org/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent/infrastructure#HTTPSourceOptions)

Sample `agent.json` which configures the agent to read from an HTTP meta data service at a custom URL.

```json
{
  "Platform": {
    "Linux": {
      "CreatePartitionIfNoEphemeralDisk": true,
      "DevicePathResolutionType": "virtio"
    }
  },
  "Infrastructure": {
    "NetworkingType": "static",
    "Settings": {
      "Sources": [
        {
          "Type": "HTTP",
          "URI": "http://10.234.228.142"
        }
      ],
      "UseServerName": true,
      "UseRegistry": true
    }
  }
}
```

Sample `agent.json` which configures the agent ot read from a config drive. See [reference sample config-drive json](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent/blob/cecf354d90f6cedf540799fb50395adb034b16d2/integration/assets/config-drive-agent.json). See [config drive integration test](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent/blob/cecf354d90f6cedf540799fb50395adb034b16d2/integration/config_drive_test.go)

```json
{
  "Platform": {
    "Linux": {
      "UseDefaultTmpDir": true,
      "UsePreformattedPersistentDisk": true,
      "BindMountPersistentDisk": false,
      "DevicePathResolutionType": "virtio"
    }
  },
  "Infrastructure": {
    "Settings": {
      "Sources": [
        {
          "Type": "ConfigDrive",
          "DiskPaths": [
            "/dev/disk/by-label/CONFIG-2",
            "/dev/disk/by-label/config-2"
          ],
          "MetaDataPath": "ec2/latest/meta-data.json",
          "UserDataPath": "ec2/latest/user-data.json"
        }
      ],

      "UseServerName": true,
      "UseRegistry": true
    }
  }
}
```

----
### <a id="meta-data"></a> Meta-data server

The meta-data server initial serves the registry URL and DNS server to be able to resolve it.

Following is a sample content od the user-data part of the HTTP meta-data

```json
{
  "server": {"name": "vm-384sd4-r7re9e"},
  "registry": {"endpoint": "http://192.168.0.255:8080/client/api"},
  "dns": {"nameserver": ["10.234.50.180"]}
}
```

The supported format of the meta-data server by the bosh-agent are documented into [UserDataContentsType](https://godoc.org/github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent/infrastructure#UserDataContentsType) and [http\_metadata\_service_test.go](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent/blob/1dca3244702c18bf2c36483c529d4e7b3fb92b2e/infrastructure/http_metadata_service_test.go)
along with the expected behavior of the bosh agent when reading this config.

----
### <a id="registry"></a> Registry

The registry provides bosh-side meta data to the bosh agent.

From [Warden CPI doc](https://github.com/cppforlife/bosh-warden-cpi-release/blob/be1869737c0bfba96662dde3499c9181863f91a7/docs/bosh-micro-usage.md):

* Registry is used by CPI to pass data to the Agent. Registry is started on a server specified by registry properties.
* SSH tunnel will be started if SSH tunnel options are provided. SSH tunnel will start reverse ssh tunnel from the micro BOSH VM to the registry port. That makes registry available to the agent on remote machine.

#### <a id="registry-protocol"></a> Registry HTTP protocol

The Agent expects to communicate with the bosh registry with a REST API documented into [api\_controller\_spec.rb](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/blob/2f73281f1a2a155ee807e7c0c9b8187c5a742f78/bosh-registry/spec/unit/bosh/registry/api_controller_spec.rb)

Reference registry client and servers implementations are available in:
* go-lang through [frodenas/bosh-registry](https://github.com/frodenas/bosh-registry)
* java through [cloudfoundry-community/bosh-cloudstack-cpi-core](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/bosh-cloudstack-cpi-core/tree/44d14a5f184d2d5e8f1f2fcd6344e734d3344673/src/main/java/com/orange/oss/cloudfoundry/cscpi/boshregistry)

#### <a id="registry-format"></a> Registry settings format

The JSON payload of the settings stored in the registry are called settings, and their format supported by the Agent is documented in [settings_test.go](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-agent/blob/ebf9a36dfddf783ffae5ae3748787d259a29374a/settings/settings_test.go)

Following is a sample content of the registry

```json
{
  "agent_id": "agent-xxxxxx",
  "blobstore": {
    "provider": "local",
    "options": {
      "endpoint": "http://xx.xx.xx.xx:25250",
      "password": "password",
      "blobstore_path": "/var/vcap/micro_bosh/data/cache",
      "user": "agent"
    }
  },
  "disks": {
    "system": "/dev/xvda",
    "ephemeral": "/dev/sdb",
    "persistent": {}
  },
  "env": {},
  "networks": {
    "default": {
      "type": "manual",
      "ip": "10.234.228.158",
      "netmask": "255.255.255.192",
      "cloud_properties": {"name": "3112 - preprod - back"},
      "dns": [
        "10.234.50.180",
        "10.234.71.124"
      ],
      "gateway": "10.234.228.129",
      "mac": null
    }
  },
  "ntp": [],
  "mbus": "nats://nats:nats-password@yy.yy.yyy:4222",
  "vm": {"name": "vm-yyyy"},
  "trusted_certs": null
}
```

----
### <a id="settings_json"></a> `settings.json` file

`/var/vcap/bosh/settings.json`: Local copy of the bootstrap settings used by the Agent to configure network, system properties for the VM. They are refreshed every time Agent is restarted.

The `settings.json` payload format is the same as the settings format initially returned by the registry.
