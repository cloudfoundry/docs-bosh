title: CPI API v1
---

## Glossary

- **cloud ID** is an ID (string) that the Director uses to reference any created infrastructure resource; typically CPI methods return cloud IDs and later receive them. For example AWS CPI's `create_vm` method would return `i-f789df` and `attach_disk` would take it.

- **cloud_properties** is a hash that can be specified for several objects (resource pool, disk pool, stemcell, network) to provide infrastructure specific settings to the CPI for that object. Only CPIs know the meaning of its contents. For example resource pool's `cloud_properties` for AWS can specify `instance_type`:

```yaml
resource_pools:
- name: large_machines
  cloud_properties: {instance_type: r3.8xlarge}
```

---
## <a id="stemcells"></a> Stemcell management

### <a id="create-stemcell"></a> `create_stemcell`

Creates a reusable VM image in the IaaS from the stemcell image. It's used later for creating VMs. For example AWS CPI creates an AMI and returns AMI ID.

#### Arguments

- **image_path** [String]: Path to the stemcell image extracted from the stemcell tarball on a local filesystem.
- **cloud_properties** [Hash]: Cloud properties hash extracted from the stemcell tarball.

##### Example

```yaml
[
	"/tmp/extracted-stemcell-348754vdsn87fr/image",
	{
		"name:" "bosh-openstack-esxi-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent",
		"version": "2972",
		"infrastructure": "openstack",
		"hypervisor": "esxi",
		"disk:" 3072,
		"disk_format": "ovf",
		"container_format": "bare",
		"os_type": "linux",
		"os_distro": "ubuntu",
		"architecture": "x86_64",
		"auto_disk_config": true
	}
]
```

#### Returned

- **stemcell_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the created stemcell (e.g. stemcells in AWS CPI are made into AMIs so cid .would be `ami-83fdflf`)

---
### <a id="delete-stemcell"></a> `delete_stemcell`

Deletes previously created stemcell. Assume that none of the VMs require presence of the stemcell.

#### Arguments

- **stemcell_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the stemcell to delete; returned from `create_stemcell`.

#### Returned

No return value

[Example delete_stemcell.go](https://github.com/cppforlife/bosh-warden-cpi/blob/master/action/delete_stemcell.go)

---
## <a id="vm"></a> VM management

### <a id="create-vm"></a> `create_vm`

Creates a new VM based on the stemcell. Created VM must be powered on and accessible on the provided networks.

Waiting for the VM to finish booting is not required because the Director waits until the Agent on the VM responds back.

Make sure to properly delete created resources if VM cannot be successfully created.

#### Arguments

- **agent_id** [String]: ID selected by the Director for the VM's agent.
- **stemcell_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the stemcell to use as a base image for new VM.
- **cloud_properties** [Hash]: Cloud properties hash specified in the deployment manifest under VM's resource pool.
- **networks** [Hash]: Networks hash that specifies which VM networks must be configured.
- **disk_cids** [Array of strings] Array of disk cloud IDs for each disk that created VM will most _likely_ be attached; they could be used to optimize VM placement so that disks are located nearby.
- **environment** [Hash]: Resource pool's env hash specified in deployment manifest.

##### Example

```yaml
[
	"4149ba0f-38d9-4485-476f-1581be36f290",
	"ami-478585",
	{ "instance_type": "m1.small" },
	{
		"private": {
			"type": "manual",
			"netmask": "255.255.255.0",
			"gateway": "10.230.13.1",
			"ip": "10.230.13.6",
			"default": [ "dns", "gateway" ],
			"cloud_properties": { "net_id": "subnet-48rt54" }
	  	},
	  	"private2": {
			"type": "dynamic",
			"cloud_properties": { "net_id": "subnet-e12364" }
		}
		"public": {
			"type": "vip",
			"ip": "173.101.112.104",
			"cloud_properties": {}
		}
	},
	[ "vol-3475945" ],
	{}
]
```

#### Returned

- **vm_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the created VM.

#### Agent settings

For the Agent to successfully start on the created VM, several bootstrapping settings must be exposed which include network configuration, message bus location (NATS/HTTPS), agent id, etc. Each infrastructure might have a different way of providing such settings to the Agent. For example AWS CPI uses instance user metadata and BOSH Registry. vSphere CPI uses CDROM drive. Most CPIs choose to communicate with default Agent hence communication settings follow certain format:

```yaml
{
	"agent_id": "4149ba0f-38d9-4485-476f-1581be36f290",

	"vm": { "name": "i-347844" },

	"networks": {
		"private": {
			"type": "manual",
			"netmask": "255.255.255.0",
			"gateway": "10.230.13.1",
			"ip": "10.230.13.6",
			"default": [ "dns", "gateway" ],
			"cloud_properties": { "net_id": "d29fdb0d-44d8-4e04-818d-5b03888f8eaa" }
		},
		"public": {
			"type": "vip",
			"ip": "173.101.112.104",
			"cloud_properties": {}
		}
	},

	"disks": {
		"system": "/dev/sda",
		"ephemeral": "/dev/sdb",
		"persistent": {}
	},

	"mbus": "https://mbus:mbus-password@0.0.0.0:6868"

	"ntp": [ "0.pool.ntp.org", "1.pool.ntp.org" ],

	"blobstore": {
		"provider": "local",
		"options": { "blobstore_path": "/var/vcap/micro_bosh/data/cache" }
	},

	"env": {},
}
```

### <a id="delete-vm"></a> `delete_vm`

Deletes the VM. Assume that all disks were detached.

To avoid losing track of VMs, make sure to raise an error if VM deletion is not absolutely certain.

#### Arguments

- **vm_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the VM to delete; returned from `create_vm`.

#### Returned

No return value

---
### <a id="has-vm"></a> `has_vm`

Checks for VM presence in the IaaS.

This method is mostly used by the consistency check tool (cloudcheck) to determine if the VM still exists.

#### Arguments

- **vm_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the VM to check; returned from `create_vm`.

#### Returned

- **exists** [Boolean]: True if VM is present.

---
### <a id="reboot-vm"></a> `reboot_vm`

Reboots the VM. Assume that VM can be either be powered on or off at the time of the call.

Waiting for the VM to finish rebooting is not required because the Director waits until the Agent on the VM responds back.

#### Arguments

- **vm_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the VM to reboot; returned from `create_vm`.

#### Returned

No return value

---
### <a id="set-vm-metadata"></a> `set_vm_metadata`

Sets VM's metadata to make it easier for operators to find categorize VMs when looking at the IaaS management console. For example AWS CPI uses tags to store metadata for operators to see in the AWS Console.

#### Arguments

- **vm_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the VM to modify; returned from `create_vm`.
- **metadata** [Hash]: Collection of key-value pairs. CPI should not rely on presence of specific keys.

##### Example

```yaml
[
	"i-387459",
	{
		"director":"director-784430",
		"deployment":"redis",
		"job":"redis",
		"index":"0"
	}
]
```

#### Returned

No return value

---
### <a id="configure-networks"></a> `configure_networks`

Modifies VM network configuration. Assume that VM can be either be powered on or off at the time of the call.

Some infrastructures do not support network reconfiguration while VM is powered on. It's safe to power off the VM, then reconfigure networks and power it back on. Waiting for the VM to finish powering on is not required because Director waits until VM's agent returns a ping via NATS.

For infrastructures that do support network reconfiguration or when VM cannot be reconfigured to a new state from its current state, `Bosh::Clouds::NotSupported` error should be raised. Director will delete the VM (via `delete_vm`) and create a new VM with desired network configuration (via `create_vm`).

#### Arguments

- **vm_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the VM to modify; returned from `create_vm`.
- **networks** [Hash]: Network hashes that specify networks VM must be configured.

##### Example

```yaml
[
	"i-238445",
	{
		"private": {
			"type": "manual",
			"netmask": "255.255.255.0",
			"gateway": "10.230.13.1",
			"ip": "10.230.13.6",
			"default": [ "dns", "gateway" ],
			"cloud_properties": { "net_id": "subnet-48rt54" }
	  	},
	  	"private2": {
			"type": "dynamic",
			"cloud_properties": { "net_id": "subnet-e12364" }
		}
		"public": {
			"type": "vip",
			"ip": "173.247.112.104",
			"cloud_properties": {}
		}
	}
]
```

#### Returned

No return value

## <a id="disk"></a> Disk management

### `create_disk`

Creates disk with specific size. Disk does not belong to any given VM.

#### Arguments

- **size** [Integer]: Size of the disk in MiB.
- **cloud_properties** [Hash]: Cloud properties hash specified in the deployment manifest under the disk pool.
- **vm_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the VM created disk will most _likely_ be attached; it could be used to .optimize disk placement so that disk is located near the VM.

##### Example

```yaml
[
	25000,
	{
		"type": "gp2",
		"encrypted": true
	},
	"i-2387475"
]
```

#### Returned

- **disk_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the created disk.

---
### <a id="delete-disk"></a> `delete_disk`

Deletes disk. Assume that disk was detached from all VMs.

To avoid losing track of disks, make sure to raise an error if disk deletion is not absolutely certain.

#### Arguments

- **disk_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the disk to delete; returned from `create_disk`.

#### Returned

No return value

---
### <a id="has-disk"></a> `has_disk`

Checks for disk presence in the IaaS.

This method is mostly used by the consistency check tool (cloudcheck) to determine if the disk still exists.

#### Arguments

- **disk_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the disk to check; returned from `create_disk`.

#### Returned

- **exists** [Boolean]: True if disk is present.

---
### <a id="attach-disk"></a> `attach_disk`

Attaches disk to the VM.

Typically each VM will have one disk attached at a time to store persistent data; however, there are important cases when multiple disks may be attached to a VM. Most common scenario involves persistent data migration from a smaller to a larger disk. Given a VM with a smaller disk attached, the operator decides to increase the disk size for that VM, so new larger disk is created, it is then attached to the VM. The Agent then copies over the data from one disk to another, and smaller disk subsequently is detached and deleted.

Agent settings should have been updated with necessary information about given disk.

#### Arguments

- **vm_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the VM.
- **disk_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the disk.

#### Returned

No return value

#### Agent settings

For the Agent to eventually format, partition and mount attached disk, it needs to somehow identify the disk attachment from inside the OS. The Agent can currently identify attached disk based on either device path, disk's ID, or SCSI volume ID. For example settings below show that CPI attached a disk `vol-7447851` at `/dev/sdd`:

```yaml
{
	"agent_id": "4149ba0f-38d9-4485-476f-1581be36f290",

	"vm": { "name": "i-347844" },

	"networks": { ... },

	"disks": {
		"system": "/dev/sda",
		"ephemeral": "/dev/sdb",
		"persistent": {
			"vol-3475945": { "volume_id": "3" },
			"vol-7447851": { "path": "/dev/sdd" },
		}
	},

	"mbus": "https://mbus:mbus-password@0.0.0.0:6868"

	"ntp": [ ... ],

	"blobstore": { ... },

	"env": {},
}
```

---
### <a id="detach-disk"></a> `detach_disk`

- **disk_cid** [String]: Cloud ID of the disk.

#### Returned

No return value

---
### <a id="get-disks"></a> `get_disks`

Returns list of disks _currently_ attached to the VM.

This method is mostly used by the consistency check tool (cloudcheck) to determine if the VM has required disks attached.

#### Arguments
