title: Create an Environment
---

An environment consists of the Director and deployments that it orchestrates. First we need to deploy the Director which then would be able to manage other deployments.

Choose your next step where to install the Director:

- [On Local machine](bosh-lite.html) [recommended for a quick test]
- [On AWS](init-aws.html)
- [On Azure](init-azure.html)
- [On Google](init-google.html)
- [On OpenStack](init-openstack.html)
- [On SoftLayer](init-softlayer.html)
- [On vCloud](init-vcloud.html)
- [On vSphere](init-vsphere.html)
