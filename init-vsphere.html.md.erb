title: Initializing BOSH environment on vSphere
---

This document shows how to initialize new [environment](terminology.html#environment) on vSphere.

## <a id="create-manifest"></a>Step 1: Create a Deployment Manifest

1. Create a deployment directory.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ mkdir ~/my-bosh
    </pre>

1. Create a deployment manifest file named `bosh.yml` in the deployment director based on the template below.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The example below uses several predefined password. We recommend to replace them with passwords of your choice.</p>

```yaml

## <a id="prepare"></a> Step 2: Prepare a vSphere Environment

To prepare your vSphere environment, use the vSphere Web Client to find out and/or create any missing resources listed below:

- Replace `VCENTER-IP` (e.g. '192.168.0.10') with the IP of the vCenter.

- Replace `VCENTER-USER` (e.g. 'root') and `VCENTER-PASSWORD` (e.g. 'vmware') in your deployment manifest with vCenter user name and password. BOSH does not require user to be an admin; however, it does need certain user privileges.

- Replace `DATACENTER-NAME` (e.g. 'my-dc') with the name of the datacenter the Director will use for VM creation.

- Replace `VMS-FOLDER-NAME` (e.g. 'my-bosh-vms') and `TEMPLATES-FOLDER-NAME` (e.g. 'my-bosh-templates') with the name of the folder created to hold VMs and the name of the folder created to hold stemcells. Folders will be automatically created under the chosen datacenter.

- Replace `DATASTORE-NAME` (e.g. 'datastore1') with the name of the datastore the Director will use for storing VMs and associated persistent disks.

- Replace `DISK-FOLDER-NAME` (e.g. 'my-bosh-disks') with the name of the VMs folder. Disk folder will be automatically created in the chosen datastore.

- Replace `CLUSTER-NAME` (e.g. 'cluster1') with the name of the vSphere cluster. Create cluster under the chosen datacenter in the Clusters tab.

- Replace `NETWORK-NAME` (e.g. 'VM Network') with the name of the vSphere network. Create network under the chosen datacenter in the Networks tab. Deployment manifest assumes that this network is `10.0.0.0/24` and Director VM will be placed at `10.0.0.6`.

## <a id="deploy"></a> Step 3: Deploy

<p class="note">Note: See <a href="migrate-to-bosh-init.html">Migrating to bosh-init from the micro CLI plugin</a> if you have an existing MicroBOSH.</p>

1. Install [bosh-init](./install-bosh-init.html).

1. Run `bosh-init deploy ./bosh.yml` to start the deployment process.

    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ bosh-init deploy ./bosh.yml
    ...
    </pre>

    See [vSphere CPI errors](vsphere-cpi.html#errors) for list of common errors and resolutions.

1. Install the [BOSH Command Line Interface (CLI)](./bosh-cli.html).

1. Use `bosh target 10.0.0.6` to log into your new BOSH Director. The default username and password are `admin` and `admin`.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh target 10.0.0.6

    Target set to 'bosh'
    Your username: admin
    Enter password: *****
    Logged in as 'admin'

    $ bosh vms

    No deployments
    </pre>

1. Save the deployment state file left in your deployment directory so you can later update/delete your Director. See [Deployment state](using-bosh-init.html#deployment-state) section of 'Using bosh-init' for more details.
