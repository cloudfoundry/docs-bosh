title: Director SSL Certificate Configuration
---

## <a id="generate"></a> Generate SSL certificates

Depending on you configuration, there are up to three endpoints to be secured using SSL certificates: The Director, the UAA, and the SAML Service Provider on the UAA.

<p class="note">Note: If you are using the UAA for user management, an SSL certificate is mandatory for the Director and the UAA.</p>

You can use the following script to generate a root CA certificate and use it to sign three generated SSL certificates:

<pre class="bash">
#!/bin/bash

set -e

certs=`dirname $0`/certs

rm -rf $certs && mkdir -p $certs

cd $certs

echo "Generating CA..."
openssl genrsa -out rootCA.key 2048
yes "" | openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key rootCA.key \
  -out rootCA.pem -days 99999

function generateCert {
  name=$1
  ip=$2

  cat >openssl-exts.conf <<-EOL
extensions = san
[san]
subjectAltName = IP:${ip}
EOL

  echo "Generating private key..."
  openssl genrsa -out ${name}.key 2048

  echo "Generating certificate signing request for ${ip}..."
  # golang requires to have SAN for the IP
  openssl req -new -nodes -key ${name}.key \
    -out ${name}.csr \
    -subj "/C=US/O=BOSH/CN=${ip}"

  echo "Generating certificate ${ip}..."
  openssl x509 -req -in ${name}.csr \
    -CA rootCA.pem -CAkey rootCA.key -CAcreateserial \
    -out ${name}.crt -days 99999 \
    -extfile ./openssl-exts.conf

  echo "Deleting certificate signing request and config..."
  rm ${name}.csr
  rm ./openssl-exts.conf
}

generateCert director 10.244.4.2 # <--- Replace with public Director IP
generateCert uaa-web 10.244.4.2  # <--- Replace with public Director IP
generateCert uaa-sp 10.244.4.2   # <--- Replace with public Director IP

echo "Finished..."
ls -la .
</pre>

## <a id="configure"></a> Configure the Director to use certificates

Update the Director deployment manifest:

- `director.ssl.key`
    - Private key for the Director (e.g. `certs/director.key`)
- `director.ssl.cert`
    - Associated certificate for the Director (e.g. `certs/director.crt`)
    - Include all intermediate certificates if necessary
- `hm.director_account.ca_cert`
    - CA certificate used by the HM to verify the Director's certificate (e.g. `certs/rootCA.pem`)

If you are using the UAA for user management, additionally put certificates in these properties:

- `uaa.sslPrivateKey`
    - Private key for the UAA (e.g. `certs/uaa-web.key`)
- `uaa.sslCertificate`
    - Associated certificate for the UAA (e.g. `certs/uaa-web.crt`)
    - Include all intermediate certificates if necessary
- `login.saml.serviceProviderKey`
    - Private key for the UAA (e.g. `certs/uaa-sp.key`)
- `login.saml.serviceProviderCertificate`
    - Associated certificate for the UAA (e.g. `certs/uaa-sp.crt`)

## <a id="target"></a> Target the Director

After you deployed your Director with the above changes, you need to specify `--ca-cert` when targeting the Director:

<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh --ca-cert certs/rootCA.pem target 10.244.4.2
</pre>

<p class="note">Note: If your certificates are trusted via system installed CA certificates, there is no need to provide `--ca-cert` option.</p>
