Task 45 error

For a more detailed error report, run: bosh task 45 --debug
</pre>

This problem can occur due to:

- blocked network connectivity between the Agent on a new VM and NATS (typically the Director VM)
- bootstrapping problem on the VM and/or wrong configuration of the Agent
- blocked or slow boot times of the VM

It's recommended to start a deploy again and SSH into one of the VMs and look at [the Agent logs](job-logs.html#agent-logs) while the Director waits for VMs to become accessible. We are planning to introduce a feature in the Director to leave unreachable VMs for easier debugging.

Error 400007: `access_z1/0' is not running after update

Task 47 error

For a more detailed error report, run: bosh task 47 --debug
</pre>

This problem occurs when one of the release jobs on a VM did not successfully start in a given amount of time. You can use [`bosh instances --ps`](sysadmin-commands.html#health) command to find out which process on the VM is failing. You can also [access logs](job-logs.html#vm-logs) to view additional information.

This problem may also arise when deployment manifest specifies too small of a [canary/update watch time](deployment-manifest.html#update) which may not be large enough for a process to successfully start.

This problem can occur if the Director is configured to use built-in blobstore and does not have enough space on its persistent disk. You can use `bosh-init` to redeploy the Director with a larger persistent disk. Alternatively you can remove unused releases by running `bosh cleanup` command.

## <a id="director-db"></a> Debugging Director database

Rarely it's necessary to dive into the Director DB. The easiest way to do so is to SSH into the Director VM and use `director_ctl console`. For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ ssh vcap@DIRECTOR-IP

$ /var/vcap/jobs/director/bin/director_ctl console
=> Loading /var/vcap/jobs/director/config/director.yml
=> ruby-debug not found, debugger disabled
=> Welcome to BOSH Director console
=> You can use 'app' to access REST API
=> You can also use 'cloud', 'blobstore', 'nats' helpers to query these services
irb(main):001:0> Bosh::Director::Models::RenderedTemplatesArchive.count
=> 3
</pre>

<p class="note">Note: It's not recommended to modify the Director database via this or other manual methods. Please let us know via GitHub issue if you need a certain feature in the BOSH CLI to do some operation.</p>

This problem typically occurs if the Director's system time is out of sync, or if the Director machine is underpowered.

</pre>

This failure occurs due to nginx configuration problems with the director and the nginx blobstore. This can be remedied by configuring the `max_upload_size` property on the director and blobstore jobs.
