title: CLI v2 vs v1
---

<p class="note">Note: Applies to CLI v2 alpha 1.</p>

| Before                      | After
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------
| bosh-init deploy <manifest> | bosh create-env <manifest>
| bosh-init delete <manifest> | bosh delete-env <manifest>
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------
| Motivation: bosh-init CLI is now absorbed by the bosh CLI. One binary!
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------
| bosh target <ip>            | bosh env <ip>
| bosh status                 | bosh env
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------
| Motivation: Use 'environment' term consistently. Matches with create-env/delete-env commands.
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------
| bosh -t dir ...             | bosh -e dir ...
| bosh -d manifest-path ...   | bosh -d deployment-name ...
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------
| Motivation: Most of the time users had to download manifest just to be able to run other commands. Instead of downloading manifest just provide a deployment name.
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------
| bosh deployment <manifest>  | bosh deployment <name>
| bosh deploy                 | bosh deploy <manifest>
| bosh delete deployment      | bosh delete-deployment (uses currently set deployment)
| bosh tasks recent 1000      | bosh tasks -r=1000
| bosh tasks --no-filter      | bosh tasks -a
| bosh download manifest dep  | bosh manifest (uses currently set deployment)
| bosh vms dep                | bosh instances (uses currently set deployment)

## <a id="general"></a> General differences

- All commands respect `-e` (environment) and `-d` (deployment) flags
- `-d` (deployment) flag accepts a deployment name instead of a manifest
- Variety of commands (create-env/delete-env/deploy/recreate/etc.) accept simple interpolation flags (`-v/-l`)
- All commands support friendlier non TTY output, forceful TTY output and `--json` formatting
- All commands now use dashes instead of spaces
- All commands expect 'piece1/piece2' formatting for instances, releases, and stemcells
- `^+C` doesnt ask for task cancellation and just exits CLI command (task continue to run)
- `--no-track` has been removed from the bosh task command
- Sorts tables in a more consistent manner
- Stores configuration file in `~/.bosh/config`
- Most of the output formatting such as tables

---
## <a id="commands"></a> Differences per command

- `bosh env`
  - only allows connections to Director configured with verifiable certificates
  - no longer asks to log-in

- `bosh login`
  - doesn't accept positional arguments for username/password

- `bosh deploy`
  - no longer checks or requires `director_uuid`
    - to achieve similar safety make sure to give unique deployment names across environments

- `bosh tasks`
  - sane arguments syntax (`-r` for recent and `-a` for all)

- `bosh ssh`
  - sane arguments syntax
  - support for running commands against multiple machines
  - adds `--ssh-opts` flag to pass through options to ssh command for port forwarding etc.
  - adds `-r` flag to collate results from multiple machines

- `bosh logs`
  - adds -f flag similar to `tail -f` (uses bosh ssh underneath)

- `bosh scp`
  - sane arguments syntax
  - support for running command against multiple machines

- `bosh vms`
  - removed second param for specifying deployment

- `bosh add-blob`
  - requires a path to its release destination
  - no longer uses symlinks to manage blobs but rather places file directly into `blobs/`
